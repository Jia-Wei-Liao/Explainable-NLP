Take the word `` kill `` for an example . If you own a Bible dictionary or concordance then it should inform you that the word kill in the Ten Commandments means to commit manslaughter . There is alot more to the actual commentary on this word and it is quite interesting . But to say that killing was breaking a specific commandment and to use that as a reasoning against capital punishment is wrong . How do you explain all the wars that rage after the commandments were penned ? How do you explain the cities of refuge set up for those folks quilty of accidentally killing another person .

All I was disputing was when you said that they ALWAYS recommended it . They do offer pregnancy counseling , along with pregnancy testing . They also offer birth control , gynecological care , STD testing , infertility testing , sexual education counseling , prenatal care , adoption referrals .. etc ... Almost all of these things are offered by my regular doctor , and probably most other doctors as well . They do n't have a maternity ward at Planned Parenthood because they are n't a hospital , and you can go to your own hospital to have an ultrasound done , but if a clinic does an abortion themselves , they have to do an ultrasound first , to determine how far along the pregnancy is , because there are different procedures for different amounts of weeks . If an ob/gyn sees an ultrasound with severe problems , they will sometimes recommend an abortion too . All in all , I just thought that your remark that Planned Parenthood always recommended an abortion was wrong . They also offer services to men too , do you think they recommend abortion to them as well ? ? I have nothing wrong with you being pro-life ... I honestly do n't . I think it 's good that you stand up for what you believe in .

The ATF shut down Red 's Trading Shop on matters as insignificant as typos . So why are n't they going in and shutting down these rogue dealers if they 're doing anything wrong ?

The statistics show both a rise and fall in gun crime : `` In the year ending 31 March 2005 provisional figures show a : `` 16 % reduction in the use of handguns 9 % reduction in robberies involving firearms 6 % reduction in serious injuries from firearms offences Despite these figures , the number of overall offences involving firearms has been increasing each year since 1997/98 . And crime involving imitation weapons was up 55 % in 2004-05 compared to the previous year . ( Source : Crime in England and Wales 2004/2005 ) `` Also of concern is a rise in the number of young people carrying real or imitation firearms in an attempt to boost their image or from a mistaken idea about self-protection. `` http : //www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-v ... ime/gun-crime/ In addition , the rise in gun crime may be mostly due to the big rise in the number of replica and air guns being used in crime : `` Imitation weapons were used in 3,332 offences in 2004/05 , an increase of more than half ( 55 % ) from 2003/04 .... Ball-bearing ( BB ) guns are easy to purchase and often look like real weapons .... Anti-firearms campaigners would like to see much tighter controls for all other types of weapons , including an outright ban on the production , sale , and possession of BB guns , airguns , and replica guns .... The police say that in 2003 replica firearms were used in an estimated 60 % of robberies and four out of five of all firearms offences . Nearly three quarters ( 72 % ) of firearms seized by the Metropolitan Police Service in 2003 under Operation Trident , set up to tackle gun crime within London\u00c2 \u2019 s black communities , were replicas , air guns , or starter pistols. `` http : //www.crimeinfo.org.uk/servlet/ ... ory=factsheets\""

Frankly you would have to have the intelligence of a house plant to follow that line of reasoning . Your take on this entire thing is ridiculous and unamerican . There is no evidence whatsoever that anything improper took place here . What happened is that a bunch of protesters who were careful not to break the law went and told a guy that he is a huge XXXXX . The DC PD sent 2 units to ensure that nobody was hurt during the course of the protest . The local police also sent units in response to calls from neighbors .

Alot of children endure harassment because of living in a house made up of parents of the same sex . Just because it did not happen to your son , dose not mean that it dose not happen .

        "text": "\"No , it 's not . The conditions under which evolution operated during the Cambrian/Vendian times were different from the conditions following that time in two main ways , and these differences can potentially account for the origin of the many animal body plans during those early periods and the lack of new ones since . First , ~540 million years ago most animals were very much simpler ( fewer cells , for example ) than they are today , so changes to their developmental programs would have been better tolerated . The more complex any system is ( the more parts it has , and the more coordinated and well-matched those parts must be , etc . ) , the more rigidly constrained and less amenable to a given magnitude of change it is . So the simpler developmental processes ( simpler adult-form end product , fewer interactions between developmental genes , etc . ) of early animals would have allowed for a 'large-scale ' change to be incorporated into that animal 's ontogeny , though if a change of the same magnitude were to occur today , it would be too disruptive to the complex developmental program and would be eliminated ( note that 'large-scale change ' refers to the adult form : the actual change that caused that altered end result could be a typical small scale mutation , in an early developmental stage ) . This it not to propose Goldschmidt 's `` hopeful monsters `` that occur due to 'macromutations ' , but rather an intermediate position between that and the `` only micromutations `` view of gradualistic neo-Darwinism . And , as just mentioned , mutations in developmental processes ( even ones that resulted in 'macromutations ' in the adult form ) would have been more tolerated in the simpler animals that existed ~540 mya than they would be in today 's . Second , ~540 million years ago animal diversity was extremely more limited than it is today , so there was a huge number of open niches : a plentitude the likes of which has never again existed on our planet . An organism that happened to find itself in one of the multitude of open niches ( by means of a `` semi-macro `` mutation , the product of a change in a developmental gene ) would have faced little if any competition . The reduced external competition would potentially allow the morphological variation ( s ) , that would otherwise likely have been eliminated , to persist . ( The sudden change could leave the organism with a lower level of internal coordination : over time , internal coadaptation could evolve to 'catch up ' with the change in morphology : these internal adjustments would leave no trace in the fossil record ) . Combining these two ideas produces a reasonable explanation of the 'explosion ' in new body plans in Vendian/Cambrian times .\""

This effect is compounded because of the anonymity ; the domineering would want to prove manhood and superiority and the submissives would want to inflict revenge , . . . especially if it is on an unsuspecting non-participant . I would go so far as to hypothesize that the submissives would put more hot sauce in the water than the `` aggressive `` domineering subjects . I actually laughed out loud when the overly concerned testers believed they needed to defuse the potentially deadly aggression they caused in the test subjects : `` Because of the potentially arousing nature of the experiment , we wanted to ensure that all subjects were reasonably calm when they left the lab . Therefore , all subjects next watched a relaxing video of nature scenes and classical musical . Given that subjects had been deceived , we next debriefed them , emphasizing that they should not feel badly about any aggressive behavior they exhibited . '' Jezz , thanks for saving us all from wanton pellet gun caused hot sauce attacks !\""

It is clear the Stevens dissent was focused on a misreading of Miller 's holding and his just for gun rights metamorphosis supporting the illegitimate assumption that the government can exercise vast unspecified and unenumerated powers just because it feels like it . In Heller Stevens abandons his belief in Roe 's `` prenumbra `` theory , that the Bill of Rights is just a rough outline of liberty interests that stand as examples of many others . I endorse Justice Harlan 's dissent in Poe without Stevens ' recent equivocation and find it to be a compelling argument in constitutional interpretation , since elevated to the opinion of the Court in a case which Stevens concurred : `` Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects . See U.S . Const. , Amdt . 9 . As the second Justice Harlan recognized : ' [ T ] he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause can not be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution . This ` liberty\u00c2\u00b4 is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property ; the freedom of speech , press , and religion ; the right to keep and bear arms ; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures ; and so on . It is a rational continuum which , broadly speaking , includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints , . . . and which also recognizes , what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must , that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment . ' '' Casey v. Planned Parenthood , 505 U.S. 833 , 848 ( 1992 ) This famous exposition is a long standing favorite of Stevens . He cited it in his dissent in Albright v. Oliver , 510 U.S. 266 , 306-07 ( 1994 ) . But he abandons his relationship with these ideals in Heller ? Give me a break . . . Who 's sacrificing his principles for policy ? At least Scalia 's error results in an outcome that is consistent with his fundamental beliefs . That can not be said for Stevens . Just for info sake , Harlan 's dissent is also quoted in the plurality ( Stevens concurring ) in Moore v. City of East Cleveland , 431 U.S. 494 , 502 ( 1977 ) , it was originally written by Justice Harlan in his dissent in Poe v. Ullman , 367 U.S. 497 , 543 ( 1961 )\""

        "text": "\"Well , it may surprise you that I believe that it is deviant to believe that same-sex marriage is immoral ( in the sense that it is abnormal ) . This is because I believe that it is normal for most people to want to treat others the way they wish to be treated themselves . I believe it is normal for others to work toward the happiness of others , especially when that happiness does not interfere with their own happiness . But it does not follow for me that one can oppose same-sex marriage and follow those rules . It seems to me that people have been told or told themselves that same-sex marriage is bad for so long that they have sort of convinced themselves to deviate from human compassion on this one issue . Well , I suppose what I just said does n't really mean much of anything , just that someone who want to spend his or her life with the one he or she loves does not qualify as `` deviant `` behavior in my book . It is not something that must be `` tolerated `` , it is something that should be enjoyed for the good present in its nature . You wrote that you do not see the benefits of same-sex marriage . I know I went into the benefits of allowing same-sex couples to adopt , but I also spoke on same-sex marriage promoting equality , freedom , and happiness . Let me expand on that . Equality seems very simple to explain . Currently those who love someone of the opposite sex and choose to enter a relationship with that person are granted a set of benefits under the law . This same set of benefits could be extended to those who love someone of the same sex , but it is not , and they are still forced to pay any costs in taxes that salary cuts from businesses that might be accrued through these benefits being bestowed upon someone else . This simple fact violates equality , and I think this is clear and easy to understand . What may not be clear is why equality is so imporant . Granting a set of rights to one group of people that another does not have elevate the first group over the second . The more equality is removed , the more one group is elevated over the other and the more that first group is leeching off of the second group . If the first group could provide those same bonuses to the second group without causing any real harm , the first group is obligated to do so . For the powerful to take things for themselves that they could just as easily share with the weak crosses the line of moral evil . Freedom might be a bit more difficult to understand . Though the government is not granting the same set of benefits that it gives opposite-sex couples to same-sex couples , it is not actually taking any anyone 's freedom to behave in the manner they please . Or is it ? By benefiting one lifestyle over another , the government is directly promoting that specific lifestyle . Taken to the extreme , the government could just as easily imprision those who do n't live the way the government commands and claim that those people have complete freedom , they just do n't have the `` benefit `` of walking around that other people get . The lack of these benefits could be considered a fine for not living the way the government intends , or more accurately , the government is promoting one lifestyle over another . To any extent which the government does this , we all lose a bit of freedom to behave in the manner that we want . Of course there are good reasons to restrict freedom , taking into consideration murder and stealing , however those are actions that cause harm to people ; they are restricted to protect the rights of others , to stop harm . I do not think that any of the reasons you listed are harms that opposite-sex marriage does not also imply , and I think most of the harms you listed are not really harms at all as explained above . In fact , same-sex marriage brings plenty of benefits ( again , as I explained above ) . This in no way warrants the restriction of freedom . Finally I come to happiness : this is the end of all governments . Governments exist to make as many of their citizens as happy as possible , or at least give them all as much an opportunity to persue happiness as they can . The ideas of freedom and equality are really only a means to help people achieve happiness , to help the achieve the best standard of living they can , to help them be able to do the things in life they want to do , to help people in any way they can . With same-sex marriage , we have the opportunity to help a set of people without bringing harm to anyone . We have the power to give the same rights that we hold to a group of people different from ourselves . We have an opportunity to help people , and I am forced to conclude that we can not call ourselves equal , we can not call ourselves the land of the free , and we can not call ourselves a morally good society if we do not take that opportunity .\""

Further `` the athiest `` gave up the idea of the universe having always been decades ago . The author is disingenuous - or ill-informed - when he suggests otherwise . At the end of a big waffle about the `` big bang `` and thermodynamics , the author asserts that `` The atheist 's assertion that matter/energy is eternal is scientifically wrong . The biblical assertion that there was a beginning is scientifically correct. `` and then leaps to `` If we know the creation has a beginning ... `` So suddenly `` the universe `` becomes `` creation `` and the `` study `` continues confident that it has established biblical creation is `` scientifically correct `` . The article then moves on to offer a series of unsupported assertions that for `` creation `` ( ie the universe ) to not have a cause , all of our `` laws of conservation of angular momentum `` and our `` laws of conservation of electric charge `` would have to be wrong . No supporting evidence is offered for these bold claims . Thus , the bible 's caused beginning ( again other religions are ignored ) fits with `` the available scientific evidence `` . Handy eh ? So now we `` know that the creation had a beginning and we know that the beginning was caused `` ( we know no such thing , but the author marches confidently on anyway ) we move onto design . Here an appeal to incredulity fallacy is neatly tied in with gross distortion of the anthropic principle and another false dichotomy to claim that everything must be designed because it could n't happen by chance . The next step is to claim that the author has shown practical proof of the Chrisian God 's existence ( other gods being ignored once more ) . How such a piece of poorly argued philosophy can be viewed as `` practical `` is n't explained . Then it neatly guides the reader to the shop by the exit : `` We have books , audio tapes , video tapes , correspondence courses , and booklets available and all can be obtained on loan without cost . Just request our catalog from ... `` In summary , the `` study `` offers up the same old sleight-of-hand `` logic `` that typifies `` proofs `` of deities , creation , design etc .

I quote : Job 40:15-24 ( New International Version ) 15 `` Look at the behemoth , [ a ] which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox . 16 What strength he has in his loins , what power in the muscles of his belly !

( In Hebrew , this literally reads , \u00c2 \u201c he lets hang his tail like a cedar.\u00c2 \u201d ) A Cedar is not a tiny insignificant tree as the hippos tail is when compared to other tails on other animals . You insult the intelligence of the ancients to imply that they could n't either name or describe a hippo by name which as you yourself admit , was a common animal in that part of the world . As for Leviathan being a crocodile or an alligator , again , are you telling me that their hides are invulnerable to arrows or spears and can not be punctured at all ? Would those animals stand firm and not flee from men who stood up to them with spears , javelins and arrows ? Not on your life . \u00c2 \u201c Though the sword reaches him , it can not avail ; nor does spear , dart , or javelin . He regards iron as straw , and bronze as rotten wood . The arrow can not make him flee ; slingstones become like stubble to him . Darts are regarded as straw ; he laughs at the threat of javelins.\u00c2 \u201d \u00c2 \u201c On earth there is nothing like him , which is made without fear.\u00c2 \u201d Leviathan \u00c2 \u201c played\u00c2 \u201d in the \u00c2 \u201c great and wide sea\u00c2 \u201d ( a paraphrase of Psalm 104 verses 25 and 26\u00c2\u2014get the exact sense by reading them yourself ) .And do you think that the writer who describes this creature is just throwing in the part about smoke , light and fire coming coming forth from its mouth for creative license ? Job 41:18-21 18 By his exhaling a light does shine , and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning . 19 Out of his mouth go burning lamps , and sparks of fire leap out . 20 Out of his nostrils goes smoke , as out of a seething pot or caldron . 21 His breath kindles coals , and a flame goes out of his mouth.I fully admit that I am incapable of either explaining or proving what this animal was , but I know it is n't any known animal which currently exists . And Isaiah might have given us the answer as to why this animal no longer exists since we know it was invulnerable to human attacks in the ancient world.Isa 27:1 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent , even leviathan that crooked serpent ; and he shall slay the dragon that [ is ] in the sea .\""

I believe that abortion should be kept legal up until the point agreed by most physicians that the child 's life is viable outside the womb . I believe that abortion is as much playing God as is in-vitro fertilization . Women who force nature to give them a baby probably make me as angry as taking away a baby makes you . I believe in adoption of the worlds children before reproduction . question two : I believe that many people that are against abortion are working on ending hunger . I also believe that those who are working to end hunger , most likey have their hands so full with the task that their time , energy and focus cant be spent on ending abortion . Thats my view .\""

Despite these precautions , we experienced that `` percentage failure `` of contraception . I found out I was pregnant several weeks in , and my fiance and I made our decision together . 2 . We had no money . We are both in college ( finishing up our Masters degrees in a few weeks now ) , and have enormous student loan fees as well as numerous other monetary problems . Right now the most we can do is finish up school and pay to keep our apartment . Pregnancy is a very expensive thing ( which is why I find it ridiculous that pro-lifers offer adoption as if it was such a great option , because adoption itself can be free , but they do n't take into consideration everything before adoption ) , and we could n't afford to have a child to give up for adoption let alone actually raise one . To add to the obvious costs of pregnancy , there is also the loss of pay as I would not be able to work ( I 'm a geologist - this involves quite a bit of strenuous outdoors work ) , which would even further affect us . Hope everything was clear to you , if you have any questions , just ask . Those were my reasons , and there are many many more that apply to different women in different ways .\""

I must quote again ... `` The current controversy is largely a reflection of different scientific philosophies , linked to ideas about race through their treatment of variation . But there is more to it . Even if they have no conscious social agenda , scientists are bound by the same preconceptions as everyone else - their social , religious , and educational backgrounds influence their choices of theories and , perhaps more important , their philosophies of science . Karl Popper noted more than once that it does n't matter where hypotheses come from , only whether they explain the evidence they are based on , wether they are subject to disproof , and whether they can hold up to enthusiastic attempts to disprove them . This philosophy forms the basis of deductive science . But hypothesis do come from somewhere , often the underlying assumptions of society . Moreover , not only the differences in sources of ideas , but also different premises scientists have held about evolution , human nature , God , and how science should be done , have always underscored the controversies about human evolution. `` Wolpoff , M & amp ; Caspari , R , ( 1997 ) `` Race and Human Evolution : A Fatal Attraction `` , p12 . I have been at pains to quote this , not because their work is in the field of epistemology ( for when I post evidence , from epistemological sources , I get the reaction I just got from you ; 'too much information'/'irrelevant to scientists !

Those with high taxes are much more able to give money without losing those things essential to a decent standard of living . Is it equal ?

If you approach the scriptures as intended and stated , you start to resemble EZ and Arch ( amongst others ) , but , their practices are cultic , seperationistic and exclusive and in the world of science and knowledge ... complete hogwash . Who 'd want to be something so regressive and backwards thinking ? Adopt the ideals and practices of the contemorary man ... and you have something approaching a double bind . Thus , you have to start pruning away cognative disonance conflicts from one side or the other . Usually it 's the system that causes you the most problems in your current life so you prune parts of the bible out you do n't like . In weeding , Jo skips over the parable of the vines . Where some vines that bear no good fruit/ are withered , are removed and replaced with new ones . This is the believer who no longer practices , withering in 'faith ' and being removed from Gods vineyard of believers . And those who convert being added in . John 15 Jo sees the passages that state `` Everything is permissable but not everything is beneficial `` as a carte blanch for being able to do anything and still go to heaven as 'once saved , always saved ' which is ironic as that 's an attitude extremist calvinist take ... it also denies free will . The ability to accept and reject this free gift of grace on a moment to moment basis . The gift is freely given to all but not all accept this gift and those who accept it can lose it . Sure , everythign is permissable simply because you can do everything but , it 's not beneficial . It could hurt you physically or emotionally or even lose you your salvation . Those who believe in once saved , always saved can often get a sense of spiritual pride and conciet . Thinking they can do things since they can justify them to themselves and if they can do that , God 's okay with it . End result is them being Matthew 7:21 The bible does NOT say `` a believer may do anything and still be saved. `` If it does somewhere , maybe Jo can point it out with appropriate scripture . As I states , and as the bible backs up numerous times , the free gift must be ACCEPTED . Think of it like this ; you MUST have the ticket to get into heaven . The only way to get this ticket is for you to get one from the ticket giver . The 'cost ' for this ticket is said to be free . The ticket giver does NOT force you to take the ticket , nor does He slip it into your back pocket while you 're not looking . Simply ASK and your shall RECIEVE . Matt 7:7-12 That 's not to say the apostate message of the pseudo-Christian is n't appealing . It tickles the ears mightily . It even allows one such as myself to enter into the small gate at the end of the narrow path ... you know the one `` But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life , and only a few find it. `` Matthew 7:14 Heck , I 've freely broken EVERY commandment and without repentance . That I did so for mostly noble reasons is beside the point . Would be nice to get an easy out and be treated as those who followed evry rule to a T. @ Matthew S , `` Would you kill or burn your child if they did these things ? what part of unconditional love and love without end do you not understand ? `` The part where my Son turn his back on me , runs far away and came to a bad end out of my sight and control ... all because he exercised his free will to do so . Heck , I 'm personally going through this right now with my eldest . The story of the prodigal son has a meaning to it you know . Turn back and repent before it 's too late . At NO time did the father rush after his errant son nor compel him to return . Heck , the father did n't even know that the son spent all his inheritance and was starving UNTIL he came home . In the end , what I find amazing is why pseudo Christians even hang on to the thin vinear of Christianity ... it 's like walking with a crutch when they know they do n't need it . They 've become so use to being told they have a broken leg , that when they realize they do n't ( or it 's been healed ) that they still cling to it . Some even trade in the crutch for a cane or wheelchair ( alternative religious belief system they take up after realizing the one they were born with is n't for them see also : Pagans who were born and raised Christian ) . Of course , ditching the crutch can have it 's own problems . Some realize they can walk unaided and begin to run ... ignoring walls and cliffs .

The article ( and I presume the paper published by the Grants ) recounts the colonization of Daphne Major by a larger ground finch , G. magnirostris , with a correspondingly larger bill . The point is that large G. fortis and small G. magnirostris are similar in size , having similar beak size . As a result , they directly competed for scarce resources . As a result , large beaked G. fortis and small beaked G. magnirostris were at a reproductive disadvantage . As a result , the smaller beaked G. fortis evolved to specialize in the smaller , more easily cracked seeds that G. magnirostris had difficulty in picking up , while G. magnirostris evolved to specialize in the larger , hard shelled seeds . Anyone interested should read Weiner , Jonathan . The Beak Of The Finch . 1994 . Vantage Books , New York . It won a Pulitzer Prize and is the story of the Grants ' research on Daphne Major .\""

And to be sure , there are some nuts who are politically active on the right who should probably be locked up for their own good . But there are plenty of nuts like that on the left as well . A Texas woman faces trial this month in Austin on charges she threatened to kill a government informant who infiltrated an Austin-based group that planned to bomb the Republican National Convention in St. Paul , Minn. , last fall . Katyanne Marie Kibby , 25 , was indicted in June by a federal grand jury in Austin . She is accused of retaliating against Brandon Darby , the community activist-turned-informant who helped federal prosecutors win convictions against Bradley Neal Crowder , 24 , and David Guy McKay , 23 . Prosecutors say the e-mail threat was made Jan. 10 . That was two days after Crowder reached a plea bargain with federal prosecutors in Minneapolis for his role in the plot to build Molotov cocktails and attack the GOP convention in September 2008 . Crowder and McKay were part of a group of activists that had gone to the Twin Cities to take part in street demonstrations . The FBI had infiltrated the group with Darby . Crowder and McKay built eight of the gasoline firebombs but didn\u00c2 \u2019 t use them , a fact law enforcement officials credited to Darby . Members of the Austin protest community heaped scorn on Darby , saying he had betrayed longtime friends and colleagues . Kibby , who lives in Houston , is free on bond . If convicted , she could face 20 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine . She could not be reached for comment . What\u00c2 \u2019 s funny is that , even as this is going on , the left is all atwitter about some gun owners legally carrying their firearms to tea parties in accordance with their 2nd amendment rights . You hear about that endlessly on news outlets like MSNBC , but I\u00c2 \u2019 ll bet Kibby\u00c2 \u2019 s name has never been mentioned on the network . Not to mention Crowder\u00c2 \u2019 s name or McKay\u00c2 \u2019 s . As far as I\u00c2 \u2019 m concerned , violence has no place in American politics right now . I firmly believe that we citizens should embrace our 2nd amendment rights as they were enshrined in the Constitution against a day when , as Thomas Jefferson put it , the \u00c2 \u201c tree of liberty\u00c2 \u201d will need to be replenished once again by the blood of \u00c2 \u201c patriots and tyrants.\u00c2 \u201d But that time is certainly not now .

Advocates on both sides of the issue believed the state posed the best chance for gay marriage to win approval since Massachusetts became the only state to do so in 2003 because the New Jersey Supreme Court has a history of extending civil rights protections . Instead , the high court stopped short of fully approving gay marriage and gave lawmakers 180 days to rewrite marriage laws to either include gay couples or create new civil unions .

These special definitions , however , do not purport to limit the \u00c2 \u201c carrying of arms\u00c2 \u201d to the circumstances they describe . No one doubts that one who bears arms on his person \u00c2 \u201c carries a weapon.\u00c2 \u201d But to say that is not to deny that one may also \u00c2 \u201c carry a weapon\u00c2 \u201d tied to the saddle of a horse or placed in a bag in a car . Nor is there any linguistic reason to think that Congress intended to limit the word \u00c2 \u201c carries\u00c2 \u201d in the statute to any of these special definitions . To the contrary , all these special definitions embody a form of an important , but secondary , meaning of \u00c2 \u201c carry , \u00c2 \u201d a meaning that suggests support rather than movement or transportation , as when , for example , a column \u00c2 \u201c carries\u00c2 \u201d the weight of an arch . 2 Oxford English Dictionary , supra , at 919 , 921 .\""

Again , from your link : Scientific progress depends on accurate and complete data . It also relies on replication . The past couple of days have uncovered some shocking revelations about the baloney practices that pass as sound science about climate change . It was announced Thursday afternoon that computer hackers had obtained 160 megabytes of e-mails from the Climate Research Unit ( CRU ) at the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) in England . Those e-mails involved communication among many scientific researchers and policy advocates with similar ideological positions all across the world . Those purported authorities were brazenly discussing the destruction and hiding of data that did not support global-warming claims . Professor Phil Jones , the head of the Climate Research Unit , and professor Michael E. Mann at Pennsylvania State University , who has been an important scientist in the climate debate , have come under particular scrutiny . Among his e-mails , Mr. Jones talked to Mr. Mann about the `` trick of adding in the real temps to each series ... to hide the decline [ in temperature ] . `` Mr. Mann admitted that he was party to this conversation and lamely explained to the New York Times that `` scientists often used the word 'trick ' to refer to a good way to solve a problem 'and not something secret . ' '' Though the liberal New York newspaper apparently buys this explanation , we have seen no benign explanation that justifies efforts by researchers to skew data on so-called global-warming `` to hide the decline. `` Given the controversies over the accuracy of Mr. Mann 's past research , it is surprising his current explanations are accepted so readily.Here 's more on this travesty : The Global Warming Scam Notice that the IPCC which has been the source for global warming lies which its defenders have been posting here for years has been deep into the scam of misinforming the public .

The only reason it is out of the shadows , so to speak , is that we have the technology to have safe and effective abortions . Making abortion illegal will not make it go away and will only add insult to injury by violating women 's rights . As I 've said , abortion will not be rarer because of litigation no matter if `` pro-life people `` or `` pro-choice people `` have their way . Women themselves need to be supported and respected in order for that to happen . Making abortion illegal will not curb abortions , it violates rights and shows extreme disrespect to women . Keeping abortion legal may not curb them itself ( only the personal views of women will do that ) , but it shows respect for women and their choices and it does not violate women 's rights either . I believe keeping abortion legal is the first step to reducing their numbers , but it is only a step .

Alcohol was a huge market for organized crime back in prohibition days . How many mobsters or gangs still have distilleries ? They only people who operate illegal distilleries nowadays are indepedant brewers in rural areas . When you can get a wide variety of quality-controlled drugs at a licensed store down the road , no one wants to pay prohibition prices to get goods of uncertain purity or quality . Organized crime goes elsewhere to seek massive profits . I think marijuana is an easy case , its blatantly obvious that most of the harm done by pot on our society comes from associated crime : drug deals gone bad or turf wars , money put into organized crime 's hands , otherwise law-abiding citizens put in jail or given criminal records . More dangerous and addictive drugs are a harder sell , I think . Drug education is broken . Often , drug education is distorted to over-emphasize the dangers of drugs , which mystifies the drug , often increases their allure and destroys confidence in the source of information because the information is obviously biased and incomplete . With or without legalization , I believe the best solution to drug abuse is preventative : quality information and education . Reduction of poverty would do a lot to curb drug abuse ( and drug-related crime ) as well . Also , marijuana use in the Netherlands actually went down after legalization , as did alcohol consumption post-prohibition in the US back in the 30 's .

        "text": "\"It 's bad enough that you claim to oppose evolution when you do n't even know what it is , but to correct someone on logic and get it backwards is really silly . If you limit your claims of creation to the simple assertion , `` God did it ! `` without any specifics as to how , then you have answered no questions and explained nothing . Such empty assertions can not be proven wrong . Such an assertion says nothing about the methods used by God , and that is what scientists study . There are lots of scientists , evolutionary biologists among them , who believe in a Creator God . Science is not a matter of proving something right . Scientific theories are explanations of the processes and mechanisms that account for the facts that have been observed . In science , the facts are the observations . The process of science is a process of testing those theories , again and again . The body of scientific knowledge is composed of tested theories that have NOT been shown to be wrong . The more a theory has been tested , the more secure it is , even to the point that it is no longer doubted by those who are informed about the topic . How many physicists do you think there are that doubt the the earth orbits the sun ? Is that a fact ? How many nuclear physicists doubt the existence of atoms or electrons ? Why is it that all creationists seem to be so ignorant of science that they think a theory is some sort of wild guess and that if they are `` proven `` they will grow up to be facts ? Did it ever occur to any of you that you should actually learn about the topic before you try to instruct others ? One thing that is always true of science is that it is predictive - and `` God did it `` offers no predictions . However , if you wish to assert that ancient mythology is a historical record of the events , you have made assertions that can be checked . For example , if you assert that the creation took place about 6 to 10 thousand years ago , then we can predict that nothing in the entire universe can be older than that . But clearly there are . And we have observed events that happened longer ago than that . For example , SN 1987 A was a supernova that was observed in 1987 within 3 hours of the first light reaching earth . It 's distance from earth has been measured by more than one method . It is 170,000 light years away . In other words , SN 1987 A exploded 170,000 years ago . A creationist 's answer is to claim that his god created the light already on its way to earth , complete with the history of an explosion that never happened . Ultimately , creationism falls back on an untestable miracle for which there is no evidence . So if you want to believe in miracles and mythology , great ! But if you wish to argue science , then should n't you at least learn what it is ? If you claim that a theory is wrong should n't you at least know what that theory is ? By the way , I am getting the definition of evolution from memory . I have been using it for many years . It was first stated some 70 or 80 years ago . Anyone who has taken a course in evolutionary biology heard a similar definition the first day of class . Any text on evolutionary biology or that has a chapter on evolution will have a similar definition .

Is it absolutely impossible for you to debate issues while actually responding to what we really say rather than reading into what we say and redefining it to fit your warped and perverse perspective ? I mean , how sick and disturbed must your powers of reason and logic be for you to interpret my argument that Man , because of our linear view of time , is misreading the fact that God placed the stars in space at the same time much more recently than it appears to us to have occurred , that God is then an epic liar ? Is God responsible for how we interpret the evidence when we attempt to do it apart from placing Him first and foremost into the equation ? Is He the liar ? Or are you who think like that deceiving yourselves by ignoring His place in the creation of time and space ? It is just completely beyond you to think from an honest and objective perspective , is n't it obvious child ! But for a more practical answer , imagine this . In the beginning , space was a void which spanned all of eternity . Only one object/energy source encompassed all of it from one end of its massive emptiness to the other , and that person was my God Yahweh . And in one second or minutes time , he spoke all of the stars that have ever existed , at different intensities and strengths , which causes them to burn out at different times . But he placed them at the very inner and outer limits of time and space at that time . Liken it to a farmer with a hand full of seeds . He pulls back his arm and throws those seeds to the end of the plot of land he is sowing at that time . To the ants on the ground , if they measured the time it would take to reach the farthest seed , it would represent a great distance , but to the farmer it was just one arms throw in time to disperse hundreds of seeds at one time . Now here we are as finite creatures who can only see time from our linear perspective . Time is plastic . Our linear measure is man made for our convenience only . That you place what we call the measure of so called light years is arbitrary at best . But I am getting too deep for you and this discussion . The point is that our God has the ability to place the stars in every corner of not only what we again , arbitrarily call our universe , but throughout all of time and space . But to we puny finite humans who have invented telescopes , it appears that these stars we are seeing today are ancient based on the perceived yet arbitrarily arrived at distance you believe they are from us . But since you are unable to even grasp the hugeness of our God , you also fail to appreciate that light years are a measure of distance rather than time . So by that definition alone , it is foolish to equate it with Earth time rather than Gods ability to reach any distant place in time and space and place stars there .\""

An orderly universe makes perfect sense if it was made by an orderly Creator . But if there is no creator , or if Zeus and his gang were in charge , why should there be any order at all ? Loren Eiseley stated ( Loren Eiseley : Darwin 's Century : Evolution and the Men who Discovered It , Doubleday , Anchor , New York ( 1961 ) : \u00c2 \u2018 The philosophy of experimental science\u00c2\u2026began its discoveries and made use of its methods in the faith , not the knowledge , that it was dealing with a rational universe controlled by a creator who did not act upon whim nor interfere with the forces He had set in operation\u00c2\u2026 It is surely one of the curious paradoxes of history that science , which professionally has little to do with faith , owes its origins to an act of faith that the universe can be rationally interpreted , and that science today is sustained by that assumption.\u00c2 \u2019 C.S . Lewis also pointed out that even our ability to reason would be called into question if atheistic evolution were true ( God in the Dock ( Grand Rapids , MI : Eerdmans , 1970 ) pp . 52-53 ) : \u00c2 \u2018 If the solar system was brought about by an accidental collision , then the appearance of organic life on this planet was also an accident , and the whole evolution of Man was an accident too . If so , then all our thought processes are mere accidents\u00c2\u2014the accidental by-product of the movement of atoms . And this holds for the materialists and astronomers as well as for anyone else 's . But if their thoughts\u00c2\u2014i.e . of Materialism and Astronomy\u00c2\u2014are merely accidental by-products , why should we believe them to be true ?

The earth is about six thousand years old . 3 . Life on earth did not have a common ancestor . 4 . Changes within existing life occur only within fixed limits . 5 . Belief in catastrophism , usually involving a global flood as the primary explanation . 6 . There was a sudden creation of the universe , life , and energy from nothing . None of the above beliefs are part of ID theory . Because ID is derived and proven using scientific evidence , it is a much more unassuming theory . ID proposes the following : 1 . Irreducible and specified complexity are reliable indicators of design . 2 . Systems in biology exhibit irreducible and specified complexity . 3 . Natural and/or undirected explanations are inadequate when it comes to irreducible and specified complexity . 4 . As a result of the above three points , Intelligent Design is the best explanation for the origin of these kinds of complexity in biological systems .\""

        "text": "\"I think his point is paulie , that if evolution is actually as evo defines it , as changes made by way of random mutations , then why does n't life reflect those random mutations ? For example , why have n't a large number of lower animals who live their lives being hunted by carnivores adapted eyes in the back of their heads as a needed early warning system to see their stalkers coming from behind them ? Especially in times of drought and famine when food is scarce ? The environmental pressure exists at those times to justify such a change , yet from fish to birds to reptiles to mammals to even insects , most every creature in creation has 2 eyes , 1 mouth , 2 ears , ( if they even have ears since some animals use vibration sensors to locate the movement of prey and predator . ) It makes sense that Eagles , Hawks and Falcons have only 2 eyes since they are apex predators which rule their skies . But they regularly swoop down on smaller birds and pluck them out of the sky for food for their young . So why have n't smaller birds found the need to evolve eyes in the back of their heads ? One reptile has a type of third eye , but it is n't for sight nor is it permanent . It is used to absorb vitamin D from the Sun for the first 6 months of life in order to help it grow into a healthy adult . Then it is covered by scales . Tuatara Fact Sheet But the question persists as to why it seemingly devolved the need for that third eye if it originally had 3 working eyes ? I mean , it did n't simultaneously evolve a poison gland or some other form of defense to replace the need for it . Now let 's look at some insects which you will invariably mention as flaws in my argument . They too have extra eyes called ocelli , not working eyes mind you ; and neither do they aid in sight but the ocelli are simple structures and are believed they only detect light levels and movement . Now why would evolution not give vulnerable flying insects perfect vision when they have allegedly had literally hundreds of millions of years and many reasons to evolve it ? Are you aware that the visual acuity of insects is approximately 1 % of that of humans ? And we all know that humans do n't have the best eye sight in the animal kingdom . MICROSCOPY-UK / MICSCAPE - Insect insights . Insect eyes . Honeybee legs . What really distinguishes evolutionists from creationists is that creationists will ask the questions fear to ask since this fraudulent gospel has so many inconsistencies which ca n't be reasonably or rationally answered , they refuse to even consider them . Keep in mind that I have pointed out scientifically documented realities about what exists within the animal kingdom , but what I will get back from you are what ifs and maybes regarding these inconsistencies . Why is it that you never look at what is evolutionary dogma and ask why if random mutation happens based on environmental , social and predatory pressures , has n't it made more diverse selections where needed , as in a working third eye in the back of animals heads , rather than in all cases follow a proscribed formula which exists today , just as it existed in the oldest fossils ever collected ?\""

Overall , I do n't think this author brought up any legitimate point against evolution except for the lack of transition species , which is an interesting topic in itself . However , if the author had proven that the world is young , the most logical explanation would be that evolution occurred in a shorter span of time , for all of our scientific evidence points toward evolution . If the author had proven that evolution had n't occurred , then the most logical explanation that some similar , natural process is the cause . But it is a great leap of faith to suggest that Creationism is correct . See , the author has made a mistake fatal in debate : he has attack his opponent 's viewpoint , then stated that since his opponent is wrong , he is correct . But that is not true , for he has not provided any reason for us to believe that he is correct . I , for example , might be contending that a bunch of Vampires carried stones together to form the Earth , then used their magic powers to make those stones into our world today . I could have then stated exactly all of the things this author stated , only replacing those Biblical quotes with writings about Vampires , and I could have come to the same conclusion . Since the evolution is wrong , then I am right . But that 's just not good enough . Even if he had proved evolution were wrong , there is no more reason to believe in the supernatural than there is to believe in Vampires , Dragons , Pixies , or any other mythological creation .

First up : omnipresence/omniscience/eternality : I 'm not sure omnipresence is the definitive word to use because it implies that there is something 'other ' than is 'present ' everywhere , alongside or behind every point in the universe . My POV is that 'God ' literally is the universe , every particle , every wave , every field . This certainly implies awareness of everything within the universe and all past events , but if you include knowledge of future events in the term 'omniscience ' I am not so sure ; time is another dimension like the spatial dimensions but it is very different in terms of what happens when you 'travel ' along it compared to travelling through space , so I have never been able to view 4D spacetime as literally 4 equivalent dimensions ; it is 3 space dimensions plus time . With this in mind , I am not sure that even a universal ( ie space-transcending ) consciousness would also transcend time .

If supersport spent half as much effort reading and understanding what bona fide scientists tell him as he spends looking for `` support `` and figuring out how to spin it , we would n't be having this conversation . Let 's put it this way . Suppose you have a friend named Fred who is in your section of organic chemistry . One day your friend comes in and says , `` Dude ! The prof 's off his rocker ! I have proof that he 's lying to us ! `` You ask Fred for some supporting evidence , and he disappears for a while . A while later , you see Fred again . '' Dude , `` he says , `` I told you . Check this out . Turns out that there are ways besides the so-called 'Grignard reaction ' to lengthen carbon chains . Wittig ! It 's all a ruse ! He 's been telling us about this , but that 's not what actually happens ! ( And man , do n't get me started on keto-enol tautomerization ; that one 's a real doozy ! ) '' You stare at him blankly , point him to the appropriate scientific papers , even invite him into the lab to run the experiment himself , but all he does is tout his own brilliance and avoid every piece of evidence you provide . Finally , Fred comes into lecture and tells you about his amazing theory that will totally overthrow all of organic chemistry . It turns out that sulfur can catenate , too , he says . This completely destroys the scientific conspiracy that organic chemistry is really about carbon compounds . In fact , Fred ends up approaching the professor -- someone who has extensive education , training , and experience in the field -- and tells the professor outright that Fred has uncovered the scientists ' evil plan to corrupt mankind and indoctrinate poor little college students into `` Grignardism. `` Incredibly , Fred does n't seem to notice that other students , the professor , graduate assistants , scientific articles , and common sense all contradict him . When presented with these problems , Fred pooh-poohs them away as a fabricated part of the conspiratorial establishment , as science as a whole has only one purpose : promoting Grignardism . Fred repeats this every week , with the same argument every time , dressed up just a little bit different . Every week , dozens upon dozens of refutations pour in , inundating little Fred with questions he ca n't answer and observations he ca n't explain . When even Fred -- the practiced little spinster that he is -- can no longer pretend in the face of such overwhelming evidence , he disappears again ... Only to start anew the next week . How long until you no longer take Fred seriously ? Do you think I 've made up this whole scenario ? Head over to IIDB and search for threads started by supersport . My story is a sadly accurate representation , although it is much too short to instill in you the understanding of the full depth of supersport 's ... `` behavior. `` IIDB has numerous practicing scientists and generally well-educated people ; they thrashed sport to pieces every single time .

He could get anywhere from a minimum of 5 years up to 40 years for selling crack , but in my experience if he pleads guilty it would be a very , very rare occurrence for him to receive an active sentence of more than 2 years per charge for being a drug dealer . This is because the judge can suspend any part of or all of his sentence , and pursuant to this judicial authority the average sentence I see for per count of selling crack is 12-18 months . But if you catch him with a gun while he is selling , then the punishment for just on offense of having the gun is an automatic 5 years which can not be suspended . I have seen many instances where the defendant gets far more time for having a gun than what he received for the actual underlying crime he commits either with or while having the gun . But to come back to the issue , if registration is aimed at identifying and/or preventing illegal transfers and illegal possession of firearms , then in my opinion that goal can not be reached because it can not be enforced . Felons found in possession are already prosecuted for having the gun without a requirement to register them . A registration requirement will not aid in either their detection or prosecution because they will not comply with the registration requirement\u00c2 \u2019 s command that they incriminate themselves\u00c2\u2014and no law can force them to register their guns so long as the 5th .

Though I have n't experienced it myself , I can well imagine that having a child can be a wonderful experience . However , I believe that there are many instances where having a baby would pose very grave difficulties . Some of these might include : - The woman might not be able to financially afford to have another child . This may be a parent who already has too many mouths to feed and would reduce the health and life opportunities of the other children if she had more children . It may be a young single woman of poor job prospects who may have no recourse but to fall back on welfare , whereas , if she waited to have children until she would be older and more prepared , she could be a better mother to those future children . - The community in which the woman lives might be extremely negative about unmarried woman having children so both she and the baby would suffer that stigma , whereas , if she secretly got an abortion , she could maintain her reputation and have children in marriage later on in a much better social environment . - Of course , there are the cases of rape , incest and a threat to the life of the mother , but I think we mostly agree on those . I think that women are generally able to decide for themselves when it would be too hard for them to have a baby , so I believe that women should have the right to choose ( at least during the first and second trimester ) - especially since it is her body that is so intimitely involved in the process . Yes , theoretically , they could put the child up for adoption , but giving a child up for adoption poses many difficulties for the woman , including the stigma and guilt associated with giving up a child . I applaud those women who are able to handle that stigma and give another couple the opportunity to adopt her baby , but I would not dream of forcing her into that decision . Unfortunately , though a lot of progress has been made in recent decades , there is still some social stigma left against those who give up children for adoption and against those who choose single motherhood ( marriage is not always a possibility ) . Reduce that stigma and you might reduce the number of abortions .\""

If we say , what does this mean for the past of th universe it can be postulated that the universe then becomes very small and hot if we go far back enough in time . We then find that the laws that describe the behaviour of the physical universe start to break down ; gravity , electromagnetism , weak nuclear force and strong nuclear force . The pursuit of a Grand Unified Theory ( GUT ) and Theory of Everything is concerned with combining the laws that describe some or all of these forces to see if we can understand how the universe behaved very shortly after it began to expand . What came before ? this is not well understood at the moment . Some workers have suggested a cyclic universe in which more than one BB has occured over time . Do n't forget though , cosmology is only concerned with the physical world , and not that which may lie outside of it . Macroevolution : how do you know that this does not happen ? if you are to say it has not been observed happening today , it is not surprising as our slow life cycles do n't lend themselves to making a direct observation .

        "text": "\"Following the original purpose of this thread , I will summarize my own views on abortion . ( Note , this is copied from an older survey on abortion beliefs - a thread in the abortion forum called `` Survey of views on abortion `` ) : For me , the question of abortion rights comes down to a balance between the rights of the mother and the rights of the fetus . On the side of the rights of the mother , there is a very important right to the control over one 's own body and to not be forced to carry something as important and taxing as a pregnancy against one 's will . Some may say that , in agreeing to have sex , a woman is agreeing to a pregnancy , but I strongly disagree . A pregnancy is a possible outcome of sex but only has a very small percentage chance if birth control is used . It would be like saying that you agree to be mugged if you walk in a bad neighborhood . The great majority of sex acts - for both married and unmarried women , religious or non-religious , conservative or liberal - are not done for the purposes of having children but are done for emotional and/or purely physical reasons . Pregnancy is the goal for only a minority of sex acts . So , women are not agreeing to a pregnancy when they have sex . In the case of unwanted pregnancies , it is a significant burden that they never agreed to . If they are forced to carry such a pregnancy , it would be a strong imposition against the rights over their own bodies . On the other hand , one has the rights of the fetus . What rights the fetus has depends on your belief system and priorities . For me , the most important thing when it comes to the rights of any human being is whether or not there is a mental existence - at least a rudimentary mind . I believe that I did not exist until I started to mentally exist and that applies to all others . My view is that , once a mental existence begins , the right to life of a fetus kicks in and takes priority over the mother 's rights over her own body , under most circumstances . The neurological view is that a mind can not exist before the third trimester . Therefore , I would allow abortion-on-demand for the first and second trimester and restrict it in the third trimester . For that third trimester , I would limit abortions to those that are done to mitigate a significant risk to the mother 's life or physical or mental health ( ex . leading to , say , paralysis or strong possibility of suicide , etc . ) and , in case of severe incurable deformations of the fetus discovered late , to end the life of a fetus that would otherwise strongly suffer ( i.e . mercy killing ) . Otherwise , I believe abortions should be restricted . If a woman has not decided on an abortion by the third trimester , she should have to carry the pregnancy to term ( minus the perviously mentioned exceptions ) . She would have had ample time to decide . Lastly , here are a couple of links which describe the neurological view of a mind not existing before the third trimester : Part 4 of http : //www.2think.org/abortion.shtml http : //7e.devbio.com/article.php ? ch=21 & amp ; id=162\""

        "text": "\"Let me interject a little 4th . Amendment primer here\u00c2\u2026 . The terms \u00c2 \u201c Terry stops\u00c2 \u201d and \u00c2 \u201c Terry frisks\u00c2 \u201d come from the landmark case of Terry v. Ohio , 392 U.S. 1 ( 1968 ) . Cases often hinge on the particular facts involved , and the facts in Terry were : `` A Cleveland detective ( McFadden ) , on a downtown beat which he had been patrolling for many years , observed two strangers ( petitioner and another man , Chilton ) on a street corner . He saw them proceed alternately back and forth along an identical route , pausing to stare in the same store window , which they did for a total of about 24 times . Each completion of the route was followed by a conference between the two on a corner , at one of which they were joined by a third man ( Katz ) who left swiftly . Suspecting the two men of \u00c2 \u201c casing a job , a stick-up , \u00c2 \u201d the officer followed them and saw them rejoin the third man a couple of blocks away in front of a store . The officer approached the three , identified himself as a policeman , and asked their names . The men \u00c2 \u201c mumbled something , \u00c2 \u201d whereupon McFadden spun petitioner around , patted down his outside clothing , and found in his overcoat pocket , but was unable to remove , a pistol . The officer ordered the three into the store . He removed petitioner 's overcoat , took out a revolver , and ordered the three to face the wall with their hands raised . He patted down the outer clothing of Chilton and Katz and seized a revolver from Chilton 's outside overcoat pocket . He did not put his hands under the outer garments of Katz ( since he discovered nothing in his pat-down which might have been a weapon ) , or under petitioner 's or Chilton 's outer garments until he felt the guns . The three were taken to the police station . Petitioner and Chilton were charged with carrying concealed weapons . The defense moved to suppress the weapons. `` From these facts we developed the law involving temporary stops and pat downs of citizens . The law regarding \u00c2 \u201c Terry stops\u00c2 \u201d can be best summarized as follows : `` [ A ] n officer who has a reasonable , articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot may conduct a brief , investigatory stop . While \u00c2 \u201c reasonable suspicion\u00c2 \u201d is a less demanding standard than probable cause , there must be at least a minimal level of objective justification for the stop\u00c2\u2026 . The officer must be able to articulate more than an \u00c2 \u201c inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u00c2 \u2018 hunch\u00c2 \u2019 \u00c2 \u201d of criminal activity `` . Illinois v. Wardlow , 528 U.S. 119 , 119 and 123-124 ( 2000 ) Therefore , a \u00c2 \u201c Terry stop\u00c2 \u201d is a \u00c2 \u201c seizure\u00c2 \u201d under the 4th . Amendment , but it is not a full arrest . The detention and questioning must be brief . Taking a man out of a theater and questioning him would be a \u00c2 \u201c Terry stop\u00c2 \u201d which would require \u00c2 \u201c reasonable , articulable suspicion\u00c2 \u201d of criminal activity . From the article it appears the judge has ruled at a preliminary motions hearing that the officers did not have the required level of suspicion to detain the man . A \u00c2 \u201c Terry frisk\u00c2 \u201d is a \u00c2 \u201c weapons frisk\u00c2 \u201d or \u00c2 \u201c pat down.\u00c2 \u201d It requires an additional reasonable and articulable suspicion of danger to justify this \u00c2 \u201c frisk\u00c2 \u201d or \u00c2 \u201c pat down\u00c2 \u201d search . In Terry the suspicion of armed danger arose from the type of suspected criminal activity ( planning a robbery ) in which it is reasonable expect that one or more of the three men involved would be armed with a weapon . Note , however , that a \u00c2 \u2018 Terry frisk\u00c2 \u201d is limited to the outer layers of clothing . The hands can not penetrate pockets , for example . The \u00c2 \u201c frisk\u00c2 \u201d is a search for weapons only . If the officer feels what he reasonably believes is or could be a weapon then he is allowed to penetrate the pocket , for example , to get the object out . But this is allowed only where it is \u00c2 \u201c immediately apparent\u00c2 \u201d from the \u00c2 \u201c frisk\u00c2 \u201d that the object is or could be a weapon . If the article is correct , then the search involved in the theater case went far beyond a weapons \u00c2 \u201c pat down.\u00c2 \u201d Absent some exigent circumstance ( and the article does not mention that any existed ) the level of search done in this case required \u00c2 \u201c probable cause\u00c2 \u201d \u00c2\u2014which is the standard of proof needed to justify a full arrest for a crime . It is possible that both the detention and the search will be held unconstitutional\u00c2\u2014but the violation is of the 4th and not necessarily the 2nd . Amendment . ( Both of which read \u00c2 \u201c the right of the people\u00c2 \u201d , in case anyone has forgotten . Will anyone here suggest the armed man can not sue because the phrase \u00c2 \u201c The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures\u00c2 \u201d guarantees only a \u00c2 \u201c collective\u00c2 \u201d and not an individual right ? ) I also want to address the article\u00c2 \u2019 s brief mention of Florida v. J.L . because it is misleading : `` United States Supreme Court in Florida v. J.L . ( 2000 ) ( detaining man on mere report that he has a gun violates the Fourth Amendment ) . `` This gives the impression that SCOTUS has ruled the police can not detain someone who is reported as having a gun\u00c2\u2014which is not the case . \u00c2 \u201c J.L.\u00c2 \u201d was a 16 year old juvenile and it was illegal for him to have a handgun . That Florida law was not in dispute , nor was the ability of the officer to make a \u00c2 \u201c Terry stop\u00c2 \u201d and conduct a \u00c2 \u201c pat down\u00c2 \u201d for a weapon if he had the required level of \u00c2 \u201c reasonable , articulable suspicion\u00c2 \u201d that J.L . had a gun . The issue was not whether the police could detain and frisk a man on a report of having a gun , but on whether the anonymous report in that case claiming he had a gun was credible enough to be relied upon to provide \u00c2 \u201c reasonable , articulable suspicion\u00c2 \u201d : `` An anonymous tip that a person is carrying a gun is not , without more , sufficient to justify a police officer 's stop and frisk of that person . An officer , for the protection of himself and others , may conduct a carefully limited search for weapons in the outer clothing of persons engaged in unusual conduct where , inter alia , the officer reasonably concludes in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot and that the persons in question may be armed and presently dangerous . Terry v. Ohio , 392 U.S. 1 , 30 . Here , the officers ' suspicion that J. L. was carrying a weapon arose not from their own observations but solely from a call made from an unknown location by an unknown caller . The tip lacked sufficient indicia of reliability to provide reasonable suspicion to make a Terry stop : It provided no predictive information and therefore left the police without means to test the informant 's knowledge or credibility. `` Florida v. J. L. , 529 U.S. 266 ( 2000 ) As I said , cases hinge on the particular facts involved . In my experience news reporters often make broad assumptions without understanding how each individual fact fits into the legal puzzle .\""

The evolution of the domestic dog The earliest remains of the domestic dog date from 10 to15 thousand years ago21 ; the diversity of these remains suggests multiple domestication events at different times and places . Dogs may be derived from several different ancestral gray wolf populations , and many dog breeds and wild wolf populations must be analysed in order to tease apart the genetic sources of the domestic dog gene pool . A limited mtDNA restriction fragment analysis of seven dog breeds and 26 gray wolf populations from different locations around the world has shown that the genotypes of dogs and wolves are either identical or differ by the loss or gain of only one or two restriction sites22 . The domestic dog is an extremely close relative of the gray wolf , differing from it by at most 0.2 % of mtDNA sequence . In comparrison , the gray wolf differs from its closest wild relative , the coyote , by about 4 % of mitochondrial DNA sequence14 ( Fig . 4 ) . Therefore , the molecular genetic evidence does not support theories that domestic dogs arose from jackal ancestors24 . Dogs are gray wolves , despite their diversity in size and proportion ; the wide variation in their adult morphology probably results from simple changes in developmental rate and timing 25 .

' The argument could be made , for example , that a 'being ' must have some sort of self-awareness . It would be quite difficult to find evidence that suggests that a developing human blastocyst has any self-awareness . So , to answer your question , regardless of what anyone believes , a post-conception entity formed from a human sperm and a human ovum is a unique human entity from that point on . My question to you : What do you consider to be the reason the pre-birth baby is a 'human being ' that deserves 'personhood ' according to the law ?\""

You know your kids wo n't understand ( and do n't yet need to ) about sex and child birth , so when your five year old comes up and asks where do babies come from SOME parents ( not all , I know I wo n't , but SOME do ) say that the stork brings babies .

But that does not mean when you slow back down you will not return to their same 'time . ' Time IS relative. `` Now I still do n't understand how time is relative or how time would slow down as you reach the speed of light , or even how you would return to their same 'time .

I 've read the rulings by the 1st , 3rd , and 10 circuits courts on the matter and I do n't understand what you 're talking about . '' Appellant , Peter B. Thomas , argues that the City of Portland , Maine , and various city officials infringed his constitutional rights by denying him a permit to carry a concealed handgun . Established case law makes clear that the federal Constitution grants appellant no right to carry a concealed handgun . See , e.g. , United States v. Miller , 307 U.S. 174 , 178 , 59 S.Ct . 816 , 818 , 83 L.Ed . 1206 ( 1939 ) ( second amendment applies only to weapons that have a 'reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia . ' ) '' Thomas v. Members of City Council of Portland ( 1st Cir . 1984 ) `` Appellant Raymond Rybar , Jr. was convicted following a conditional guilty plea to two counts of violating 18 U.S.C . Section ( s ) 922 ( o ) , which makes it 'unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machine gun . ' On appeal , he argues that the district court erred in rejecting his challenge to that provision as beyond Congress ' commerce power and as violating the Second Amendment . Neither challenge is persuasive .... In support , Rybar cites , paradoxically , the Supreme Court decision in United States v. Miller , 307 U.S. 174 ( 1939 ) , where the Court upheld the constitutionality of a firearms-registration requirement against a Second Amendment challenge . Rybar draws on that holding , relying on the Miller Court 's observation that the sawed-off shotgun in question had not been shown to bear 'some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia . ' Brief of Appellant at 24-25 ; Miller , 307 U.S. at 178 . Drawing from that language the contra positive implication , Rybar suggests that because the military utility of the machine guns proscribed by Section ( s ) 922 ( o ) is clear , a result contrary to that reached in Miller is required , and the statute is therefore invalid under the Second Amendment .... We note first that however clear the Court 's suggestion that the firearm before it lacked the necessary military character , it did not state that such character alone would be sufficient to secure Second Amendment protection . In fact , the Miller Court assigned no special importance to the character of the weapon itself , but instead demanded a reasonable relationship between its 'possession or use ' and militia related activity .... Rybar 's invocation of this statute does nothing to establish that his firearm possession bears a reasonable relationship to 'the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia , ' as required in Miller , 307 U.S. at 178. `` U.S. v. Rybar ( 3rd . Cir . 1996 ) `` the courts consistently have found no conflict between federal gun laws and the Second Amendment , narrowly construing the latter to guarantee the right to bear arms as a member of a militia .... `` United States v. Graves ( 3rd Cir . 1977 ) `` The purpose of the second amendment as stated by the Supreme Court in United States v. Miller , supra at 178 , 59 S.Ct . 816 , was to preserve the effectiveness and assure the continuation of the state militia. `` United States v. Oakes ( 10th Cir . 1977 )\""

The modern creationists now propose that Noah only took a few `` kinds `` onto the ark , and after the flood these few kinds evolved into the diversity we see today . Ironically , creationists have to accept Darwin 's theory to solve an important problem that they had , and they do n't even give Darwin the credit for this .\""

        "text": "\"This is where intuitive , ready agreement with the opening paragraph starts to get the reader into trouble . All facts are interpreted according to presuppositions , so it 's only fair that Creationists should get to bring their presuppositions to the table just like everyone else , right ? Well , let 's apply that same blanket reasoning to other situations and see what happens . Imagine a juror whose personal prejudices lead him to presuppose the guilt of a defendant based on her skin colour , and to interpret the facts of the case accordingly . Should he be allowed to sit in judgement ? Of course not - but according to the reasoning presented by AiG that leaves us in an impossible position : by eliminating those jurors predisposed to return a guilty verdict based upon race , we necessarily cede the court to those predisposed to return an innocent verdict based upon race . Our intuition rightly rebels at this false dichotomy . We readily apprehend the existence of a middle ground wherein skin colour confers neither automatic guilt nor automatic innocence . Ah , but ! Is that neutrality itself not merely another presupposition , another axiom through which the facts are being interpreted ? One might protest that it is not , that the irrelevance of skin colour as a determinant of guilt can be determined empirically . But it would be in vain , because there are , after all , no such thing as 'brute facts ' . The data you supply to justify your position only do so when interpreted according to your presupposition that guilt can be race-agnostic . To someone whose presupposition is otherwise , your 'facts ' mean something quite different - they might for instance mean the research itself must be corrupt and biased , or at least faulty in some unknown way . In short , following Ken Ham 's reasoning we find ourselves deep in a rabbit hole with no end in sight . We can venture to justify no opinion or belief , because the facts that appear to support one may upon the least whim be reinterpreted in the light of another . I may if I so choose presuppose the bible to be the work of the devil himself , and I am not to be chastised nor deterred through argument , for the axioms by which I choose to interpret the world are , in Ken 's eyes , inviolate . This is hardly the result Ken could have intended . What 's gone wrong ? Why has his fair-minded attempt to level the playing field backfired so badly ? The answer , of course , is that the playing field is n't really level . Every once in a while someone will decide that he can fly , and attempt to demonstrate this facility to the world by leaping from a high place . The world thus far has remained largely unimpressed . This is an extreme example of what can happen when the axioms one uses to interpret the world conflict with those upon which it really operates , and it provides the first key to unlocking our dilemma : Good axioms yield accurate predictions . As Ken rightly observed , known facts are always subject to interpretation . But the reverse process , the prediction of facts yet to come based on a formulated theory , is not . In making a prediction we are forced to stop shoehorning data into our preconceived worldview and make a statement about what we will find . This yields the closest thing we have to a truly objective measurement of congruence between theory and reality . This understanding allows us to validate or repudiate the presuppositions we bring to bear on the facts at our disposal . The racist juror would from the outset predict the evidence to be presented would turn out to be stacked against the defendant , but his low 'hit rate ' would invalidate his axiom . So , part of what distinguishes Creationism from mainstream scientific understanding is that , in hindsight and on an ongoing basis its predictions fall wide of the mark . The discovery of shared pseudogenes should have been all but impossible , as should identically located retroviral insertions . We should not have found fossils at all , let alone a nested hierarchy of forms . We should not have been able to observe evolution and speciation . We should not have been able to see very distant stars and galaxies . All of these unexpected face-plants for Creationism have of course been rationalised away after the fact . Shared pseudogenes must all have some function we do n't know about ; there must be some determinism in the location of ERVs ; fossils and the geological column were all laid down in the Great Flood ; the speed of light and the rate of decay of radioactive materials were different in the past . But these rationalisations entail further predictions : we ought not to be able to safely remove pseudogenes if they are functional - but we can . If ERV insertion is deterministic we should see that in the lab - but we do n't . If fossils were laid down by the flood we would n't expect similar animals to be sorted by depth according to the number of cusps on a back tooth , or to be buried in amongst consistent strata of pollen grains , and we would n't expect there to be anything like as much limestone . If decay rates had been high enough in the past to explain what we see today in just 10,000 years , we ought to now be breathing incandescent rock vapour instead of air . And so on . Science also changes to accommodate the unexpected - but as often as not the 'unexpected ' has been discovered by scientists extrapolating existing theories to their logical conclusions , predicting something we did n't initially suspect but which has later been confirmed . And that 's the bottom line : Creationism and science both evolve as new facts emerge , but while the result for science has been a trend towards better and more accurate predictions , indicative of closing the gap between theory and reality , Creationism remains a tumbling snowball of post-hoc rationalisation growing around a hard core of sacred axioms that - it would certainly appear thus far - make it impossible for the convergence of prediction and reality to occur .\""

        "text": "\"First of all , let 's compare the `` B `` specimen in this fossil link to the modern specimen and point out any significant difference to me . Secondly , shortly after the discovery was made of the living fish , but before the fix was in to excuse the massive assumptions evolutionists previously made regarding what the fossil represented , Nat Geo reported the truth about the claims evolutions had made prior to finding this fish alive and well and basically unchanged after an alleged hundreds of millions of years . One example that amply demonstrates the accuracy of evolutionary dating and sequencing of fossil fish , or any fossil for that matter , would be the story of the coelacanth . This is a genuine fish story . For many years evolutionists had assured us that the coelacanth , a member of the crossopterygian family and a supposed link to amphibians , had most definitely been extinct for at least sixty million years , at least according to their precise methods of dating and their exact analysis of the indisputable evidence of the fossil record . No doubt about it , the coelacanth died out millennia ago along with the dinosaurs , at least until a living coelacanth was dredged up off the coast of Africa in 1938 . Since then hundreds of live coelacanths have been found . In the June , 1988 National Geographic Magazine they featured numerous pictures of the coelacanth swimming around in the ocean depths , where they differ very little from the ones found entombed in the fossil layers , thus providing no evidence of any kind of evolution occurring for the coelacanth , despite the fact that the evolutionists say these fish have been swimming around for at least four hundred million years . The ancient coelacanths , from the first time they appeared in the fossil record were virtually identical to the living ones we find at the present day , extending all the way back through the geologic record past the Paleogene age of the mammals ( 63 million years ) , before the Cretaceous and Jurassic age of the dinosaurs ( 100 million through 225 million years ago ) , before the Triassic age of early mammals ( 200 million through 250 million years ago ) , before the Permian age of early reptiles ( 250 million through 300 million years ago ) , before the Carboniferous age ( 300 million through 370 million years ago ) , all the way back to the Devonian era , 400 million years ago in the fossil record , according to the time scale of the evolutionists . Initially it could n't be admitted that a living coelacanth had appeared that was identical to a species that evolutionists had calmly assured us was extinct for so many millions of years . Thus when a live example of this extinct fish had been found , J.L.B . Smith , a chemist and ichthyologist at Rhodes University in Grahamstown University , South Africa , pronounced it an entirely new genus and species , differentfrom any coelacanth previously recorded as fossils . Smith gave the living coelacanth a very scientific name , Latimeria chalumnae , after Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer who discovered the fish , and the mouth of the Chalumna River where it was captured . Just how different is this fish from the ancient coelacanth ? On pp.832 of the National Geographic article of 1988 , there is a study of the comparative anatomy between the living and ancient coelacanth with this caption next to pictures of each one . They state : `` LIKE CARBON COPIES , the tail of a live coelacanth and a 140-million year-old fossil virtually match. `` They go on to report : `` Few creatures have endured such an immense span of time with so little change as the coelacanth . The cut-away drawing of a present-day specimen seems almost identical with the 140-million year-old fossil found in a quarry in southern West Germany . It is that extraordinary lack of change that enabled Professor J.L.B . Smith in Grahamstown to identify the coelacanth caught in South Africa in 1938 from a rough sketch , although he had never seen a live specimen . '' ( 30 ) Throughout the entire history of vertebrate animals the coelacanth appears , differing very little in structure , showing absolutely no signs of evolving from one species and/or changing into any other kind of species through the supposed millions of years of it 's existence . It would seem that giving the newly discovered living coelacanth the status of an entirely new species and genus was simply to hide their embarrassment while they were scrambling to come up with some kind of an explanation as to why they had been so sure that it had been extinct for sixty million years . I think there 's something fishy here in what the evolutionists have been trying to tell us . This is true of virtually all fossils found , whether sharks or sand-dollars , they show no signs of evolutionary change to or from another distinct species . Evolutionists had long speculated that the crossopterygians ( the class of fish including the coelacanth ) , because they had bony elements in their fins , may have had the ability to walk while in the water on the floor of the sea , which somehow led to the development of legs to walk on the land . This scenario was put to rest when the authors wrote in the National Geographic article : `` Our films settled another question that has intrigued scientists : whether the coelacanth can walk on its lobed fins . Though we observed several individuals resting with their fins braced against the sea bottom , we never saw any of them walk , and it appears the fish is unable to do so . '' ( 31 ) It should be noted that the coelacanth does not lay eggs like most fish , amphibians and reptiles do , but gives live birth . Thus as evolutionists had tried to connect the coelacanth with some unknown link between amphibians and fish , this would put it in a rather dubious position as an intermediary candidate . The red-tailed sun perch off the northwest coast of the United States also gives live birth after nine months , two thirds of all existing sharks give birth to live , wriggling , little , sharks , some lizards give live birth , so a supposed evolutionary sequence demonstrating how fish , amphibians and reptiles lay eggs while only mammals and marsupials give live birth would be in serious trouble.The Fossil Record Here 's the relevant point of exposing how evolutionists dealt with defining the Coelacanth . Before evolutionists knew that living examples of this fish existed , they never even hesitated in taking the observable physical features it exhibited and thought nothing of creating a completely inaccurate and totally fictional biography of that fish 's evolutionary journey . They not only claimed that it crawled on the Sea bottom which proved it was an intermediary fish , but they made assumptions based on the fact that it birthed its young live rather than being an egg layer . Here is Hans Fricke 's own story regarding the investigation into the coelacanths natural habitat which Nat Geo 's story is based upon . And notice the last paragraph in the story . The Fish That Time Forgot - Sidebar - MSN Encarta IT SAY 'S THIS : I confess I 'm sorry we never saw a coelacanth walk on its fins . Professor Smith himself nicknamed the coelacanth Old Fourlegs in the belief that the creature actually did walk upon the seafloor like a seal on its flippers . Alas , that does not seem to be the case . For every myth we dispelled , however , I 'm certain there are a dozen fascinating discoveries still to be made . In short , we have just begun to know the coelacanth.So even though this man is in no way an anti-evolutionist , even he had to admit that what had been not only assumed to be true about the coelacanth , but had been widely reported as a discovery which was supported by documented fossil evidence , was a complete myth . Which I believe and assert can be said for all of the so called evidence which exists for the pseudo science of evolution .\""

Upon first passage , the Sullivan Act required licenses for New Yorkers to possess firearms small enough to be concealed . Possession of such firearms without a license was a misdemeanor , carrying them was a felony . The possession or carrying of weapons such as brass knuckles , sandbags , blackjacks , bludgeons or bombs was a felony , as was possessing or carrying a dagger , `` dangerous knife `` or razor `` with intent to use the same unlawfully `` . Named for its primary legislative sponsor , state senator Timothy Sullivan , a notoriously corrupt Tammany Hall politician , it dates to 1911 , and is still in force , making it one of the older existing gun control laws in the United States . Many believe the act was to discriminate against immigrants in New York , particularly Italians , as the first person arrested under the law was mobster Giuseppe Costabile . Whether this was part of the law 's intent , it was passed on a wave of anti-immigrant rhetoric as a measure to disarm an alleged criminal element . The police granted the licenses , and could easily discriminate against `` undesirable `` elements . Sponsor `` Big Tim `` Sullivan reputedly desired the law so that his criminal cohorts could go about their activities unimpeded by citizens defending themselves with concealed handguns . It was used against political enemies by dropping a small pistol into an overcoat pocket . Thus having them arrested and put in jail for violation .

We might need a new thread for this topic ! Most elucidating , and worth quoting is : In the Syballine Oracles , written by an Egyptian Jew probably between 163 and 45 B.C. , the author compared Jews to the other nations : The Jews & # 8220 ; are mindful of holy wedlock , and they do not engage in impious intercourse with male children , as do Phoenicians , Egyptians , and Romans , specious Greece and many nations of others , Persians and Galatians and all Asia. & # 8221 ; And in our times , sex historian Amo Karlen wrote that according to the sex researcher Alfred Kinsey , & # 8220 ; Homosexuality was phenomenally rare among Orthodox Jews. & # 8221 ; To a world which divided human sexuality between penetrator and penetrated , Judaism said , & # 8220 ; You are wrong & # 8212 ; sexuality is to be divided between male and female. & # 8221 ; To a world which saw women as baby producers unworthy of romantic and sexual attention , Judaism said , & # 8220 ; You are wrong & # 8212 ; women must be the sole focus of men 's erotic love. & # 8221 ; To a world which said that sensual feelings and physical beauty were life 's supreme goods , Judaism said , & # 8220 ; You are wrong & # 8212 ; ethics and holiness are the supreme goods. & # 8221 ; A thousand years before Roman emperors kept naked boys , Jewish kings were commanded to write and keep a sefer torah , a book of the Torah . .... nothing moved me more than the Talmudic law that Jews were forbidden to sell slaves or sheep to non-Jews , lest the non-Jews engage in homosexuality and bestiality . That was the world in which rabbis wrote the Talmud , and in which , earlier , the Bible was written . Asked what is the single greatest revelation I have derived from all my researches , I always respond , i & # 8220 ; That there had to have been divine revelation to produce the Torah. & # 8221 ; The Torah was simply too different from the rest of the world , too against man 's nature , to have been solely man-made . The creation of Western civilization has been a terribly difficult and unique thing . It took a constant delaying of gratification , and a re-channeling of natural instincts ; and these disciplines have not always been well received . There have been numerous attempts to undo Judeo-Christian civilization , not infrequently by Jews ( through radical politics ) and Christians ( through anti-Semitism ) . The bedrock of this civilization , and of Jewish life , has been the centrality and purity of family life . But the family is not a natural unit so much as it is a value that must be cultivated and protected . The Greeks assaulted the family in the name of beauty and Eros . The Marxists assaulted the family in the name of progress . Judaism & # 8217 ; s Sexual Revolution : Why Judaism ( and then Christianity ) Rejected Homosexuality - Click Here\""

When disected , the beetles of which you speak have fully formed wings under the fused wing covers ( which are themselves modified wings in beetles ) . It seems that time , in an evolutionary sense , has not been sufficent to make your `` wingless `` beetles wingless . Since the wing covers are fused , the underlying wings are useless . In another environment that would not be an advantage.This makes perfect sense in an evolutionary scenario . Wingless ( or fused wing cover ) beetles in my back yard get snapped up by the anole and the geckos .

As I mentioned in a previous post , without further criterion , `` survival of the fittest `` is a tautology . But Darwin did offer further criterion in chapter after chapter years before he acquiesced to use the phrase . Certainly Montalban has read `` Origin `` since he quotes it . How is it that he missed chapter 2 ? How is it that he failed to understand Darwin 's meaning in chapter 1 ? But I will concede that `` Origin `` is not an easy read . Understanding requires a command of English beyond the ordinary , as well as an understanding of biological science at a graduate level . Darwin was not addressing a popular audience , even though his book became popular . Darwin was addressing the naturalist of his day - what came to be called biologists in our day . English grammar and usage has evolved since Darwin 's day and biology has advanced . When one considers the importance to evolutionary theory of what Darwin said ( even without the misunderstandings of the uneducated ) , it is a matter of historical significance only . Darwin 's theories have been supported or falsified many times over . For the most part , his theories have been supported . He was wrong on some minor points . Essentially , a quote from Darwin without reference to some meaningful publication since is quite meaningless .\""

The question always boils down to just what is the underlying cause or mechanism which results in this property . Some free-will advocates will claim that free-will MUST be non-deterministic since if it were not it would not be `` free `` that deterministic processes can not lead to choice as they EXPERIENCE it . However this implies a depth of knowledge which they do not have - namely a detailed knowledge of the ins and outs of how their brain works . In addition a debatable assumption is made which is in effect that deterministic systems can not achieve that which is being experienced . This makes the claim that the free-will advocate KNOWS the actual limits of what deterministic systems can and can not do . Thats an assumption I am not willing to accept since nobody really knows the limits of behavior of deterministic systems . IMHO the experience of free-will is real enough , but the mechanism is materialistic and even deterministic down to its foundations . In other words IMHO deterministic processes are capable of generating the mental experience we describe as free-will . By the way - what is free-will free of exactly ? You do realize that it was originally formulated to get around the problem within theology of how to separate responsibility and accountability for sin from the sinless godhead ?\""
