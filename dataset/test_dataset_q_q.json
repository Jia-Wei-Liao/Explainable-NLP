Nine students and three teachers were among the dead , State Interior Minister Heribert Rech said . It was Germany 's worst shooting since another teenage gunman killed 16 people and himself in another high school in 2002 . Most of the slain students were found dead in the school and the gunman killed an adult outside the building as he escaped , regional police spokesman Klaus Hinderer said . '' He went into the school with a weapon and carried out a bloodbath , `` said regional police chief Erwin Hetger . '' I 've never seen anything like this in my life. `` After the attack , the suspect fled the Albertville high school toward the center of Winnenden , a town of 28,000 , Hinderer said , before police tracked him down . The teenager graduated from the school last year , police said . Witnesses said students jumped from the windows of the school building after the gunman opened fire . Concerned parents quickly swarmed around the school , which was evacuated during the incident . The man entered the school at 9:30 a.m. and opened fire , shooting at random , police said . Police said the suspect was dressed in a black . About 1,000 children attend the school , located in a suburb some 12 miles northeast of Stuttgart . In 2002 , 19-year-old Robert Steinhaeuser shot and killed 12 teachers , a secretary , two students and a police officer before turning his gun on himself in the Gutenberg high school in Erfurt . Steinhaeuser , who had been expelled for forging a doctor 's note , was a gun club member licensed to own weapons . The attack led Germany to raise the age for owning recreational firearms from 18 to 21 .\""

This position is in opposition to the maxim that the Bill of Rights is not the exhaustive listing of the citizen 's rights and is a fruition of the Federalist 's fears and warnings about the dangerousness of trying to list rights . Conservative opposition to Roe and abortion rights in general belie their supposed allegiance to the concept of a government with strictly limited powers -- for saying that a unenumerated right does not exist where no power is conferred to act in that arena is stating that no limits on government 's power exist . . . That government power shall fill the void , not liberty . Scalia 's error in Heller was trying to explain the 2nd as a historical entity instead of explaining SCOTUS 's application of the Amendment in prior cases . Heller neither stated or established anything new ; there never was a `` state `` or `` collective `` right aspect to the 2nd . . . It was always interpreted by SCOTUS to be an individual right exercisable , claimable and enforceable by individuals separately from any militia connection . I just wish Scalia had restated and relied on SCOTUS 's prior holdings that the right is not created , granted or otherwise established by the Amendment so the right is not dependent in any manner upon the words of the Amendment . . . Why he engaged in the linguistic analysis I 'll never know or understand . Is there a point here ? Did n't the dissenting Justices all agree that the right is an individual right , claimable and enforceable by individuals ? It is clear the Stevens dissent was focused on a misreading of Miller 's holding and his just for gun rights metamorphosis supporting the illegitimate assumption that the government can exercise vast unspecified and unenumerated powers just because it feels like it . In Heller Stevens abandons his belief in Roe 's `` prenumbra `` theory , that the Bill of Rights is just a rough outline of liberty interests that stand as examples of many others . I endorse Justice Harlan 's dissent in Poe without Stevens ' recent equivocation and find it to be a compelling argument in constitutional interpretation , since elevated to the opinion of the Court in a case which Stevens concurred : `` Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects . See U.S . Const. , Amdt . 9 . As the second Justice Harlan recognized : ' [ T ] he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause can not be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution . This ` liberty\u00c2\u00b4 is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property ; the freedom of speech , press , and religion ; the right to keep and bear arms ; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures ; and so on . It is a rational continuum which , broadly speaking , includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints , . . . and which also recognizes , what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must , that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment .

Planned Parenthood , 505 U.S. 833 , 848 ( 1992 ) `` Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects .

They crammed these critters in a sea worthy vessel made exclusively of gopher wood . The gopher wood was structurally sound enough to support the weight of said critters . The ark floated about like a cork for 40 days , etc whereupon the cargo was released to repopulate the world to present population levels . Meanwhile , there must have been provisions on the Ark for marine animals and fish as the rainwater would have undoubtedly altered the water pH and saline content . Also not mentioned is the fact that Noah and sons must have collected seeds from every PLANT on earth because I am personally not aware of many plant types that can survive completely submerged for 40 days . So you see , it is much harder to believe in a fossil record and sediment deposit stratigraphy , than in a giant boat crammed to the gills full of elephants , octopus , and cacti .

The law regarding the carry and use of pepper spray does not make any sense to me . In all of these places , I am not legally permitted to carry pepper spray because of my age .

With child molesters , rapists , robbers , etc out there just waiting to take advantage of a minor because of his/her small size , would n't the carrying of pepper spray not only be legal but encouraged ? I do n't understand how any state could leave one of their physically weakest minorities so vulnerable . I can understand limiting the possession of knives and guns to minors , because those are both deadly weapons and , to be frank , some of my peers are numbskulls . But , both pepper spray and stun guns have been proven to do no permanent damage to the human body . By the time one is about 15 , one is responsible enough to know not to spray someone because `` he gave me a funny look `` , `` I do n't like him `` , or employ its use in a fist fight . If every child molester knew most teenagers were packin non-lethal weapons , do you think he would still attack ? Can someone please explain this to me ?\""

If it should n't mean it , but it is used so that it does , then that 's what it actually means . Creationism means religion , but it also involves a belief in the authenticity of historical documents that have been meticulously preserved over thousands of years . That 's not just religion , it 's secular , observed history - something evolution does n't have . So if a person hearing your statement does n't consider it carefully , it 's very easy to be mislead by it . It implies that `` evolution `` ( the branch that declares that the book of Genesis is false ) is somehow a secular , observable truth - while creationism is nothing but a religion , a superstition . Since evolution ca n't prove the book of Genesis ( ancient history ) false , and creationism does have some historical backing , they are comparable and they directly conflict . The problem is , a school teacher can make the statement you made , and it ca n't be legally questioned by anyone . Yet there was a case that I read about somewhere , where a sticker was placed in science textbooks advising children to study evolution `` with an open mind `` , and an ACLU lawsuit ensued . Of all those likely to be mislead by your statement , it 's young impressionable school children . Publicly paid school teachers misleading them with statements like that , without a full explanation ( prohibited by the courts ) does get an establishment of atheism started . It 's what I mean when I say that when church and state are separated , atheism and state are combined . Maybe government could be neutral , if it was small . The U.S. government is no longer small .

If you abhor it as 'murdering innocent children ' -- good for you ! I am posting this information because it is something that I discovered recently while investigating various methods of birth control ... And I believe that many people are not aware of the information I communicate here . I was n't . Take it for whatever it 's worth . If the issue is important to you for any reason , I encourage you to do some research on the subject . ) The answer depends on the definition of 'abortion . ' According to currently accepted medical terms , 'pregnancy ' does not begin until the point of implantation of the embryo in the uterine wall . And 'abortion ' is the termination of a pregnancy . So , according to the currently accepted medical terminology , the answer is no , of course not ! However , if you define 'abortion ' as the termination of a physical entity that has been developing since the point of fertilization , then there is significant evidence to suggest that the answer is yes . And absolutely no evidence to suggest that the answer is no . The birth control pill has three primary functions ( as do most hormonal bc agents ) : 1 . The primary function of the pill is to prevent ovulation , but sometimes ovulation occurs while on the pill . 2 . A secondary function of the pill is to slow sperm down so that they do not reach the ovum in order to fertilize it , but sometimes the sperm does reach the ovum in time to fertilize it . 3 . The third function of birth control pills is to create a less hospitable environment for a fertilized egg to implant in the uterus , but sometimes the fertilized egg does implant in the uterine wall , as evidenced by a 'failure rate ' when women are on the pill . ( In other words , sometimes women get pregnant while on the pill , indicating that all three functions of the pill failed . ) It is widely recognized by pill manufacturers and within the medical/scientific community that the effects of the pill can and sometimes do arrest the development of a human embryo that has not yet implanted itself into the uterine wall by 'creating a less hospitable environment for the embryo . ' How often this happens is uncertain ( some estimates are as high as 50 % while some estimates suggest percentages in the low single digits ) , but there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that it can and does happen . Your physician may or may not be aware of this . Ask her/him if you are concerned . Your physician also may assert that birth control pills do not cause 'abortions ' because according to accepted medical terminology , pregnancy does n't begin until implantation . While I do not personally believe abortion is 'wrong , ' some people DO believe it is wrong . If you do believe that abortion ( as in terminating the development of an entity after conception ) then you may logically also have to believe that using the pill for birth control is wrong as it may lead to an abortion prior to implantation .

        "text": "\"Change Nobody Believes In A bill so reckless that it has to be rammed through on a partisan vote on Christmas eve . Mr. Obama promised a new era of transparent good government , yet on Saturday morning Mr. Reid threw out the 2,100-page bill that the world 's greatest deliberative body spent just 17 days debating and replaced it with a new `` manager 's amendment `` that was stapled together in covert partisan negotiations . Democrats are barely even bothering to pretend to care what 's in it , not that any Senator had the chance to digest it in the 38 hours before the first cloture vote at 1 a.m. this morning . After procedural motions that allow for no amendments , the final vote could come at 9 p.m. on December 24 . Even in World War I there was a Christmas truce . The rushed , secretive way that a bill this destructive and unpopular is being forced on the country shows that `` reform `` has devolved into the raw exercise of political power for the single purpose of permanently expanding the American entitlement state . An increasing roll of leaders in health care and business are looking on aghast at a bill that is so large and convoluted that no one can truly understand it , as Finance Chairman Max Baucus admitted on the floor last week . The only goal is to ram it into law while the political window is still open , and clean up the mess later . * * * & # 8226 ; Health costs . From the outset , the White House 's core claim was that reform would reduce health costs for individuals and businesses , and they 're sticking to that story . '' Anyone who says otherwise simply has n't read the bills , `` Mr. Obama said over the weekend . This is so utterly disingenuous that we doubt the President really believes it . The best and most rigorous cost analysis was recently released by the insurer WellPoint , which mined its actuarial data in various regional markets to model the Senate bill . WellPoint found that a healthy 25-year-old in Milwaukee buying coverage on the individual market will see his costs rise by 178 % . A small business based in Richmond with eight employees in average health will see a 23 % increase . Insurance costs for a 40-year-old family with two kids living in Indianapolis will pay 106 % more . And on and on . These increases are solely the result of ObamaCare & # 8212 ; above and far beyond the status quo & # 8212 ; because its strict restrictions on underwriting and risk-pooling would distort insurance markets . All but a handful of states have rejected regulations like `` community rating `` because they encourage younger and healthier buyers to wait until they need expensive care , increasing costs for everyone . Benefits and pricing will now be determined by politics . As for the White House 's line about cutting costs by eliminating supposed `` waste , `` even Victor Fuchs , an eminent economist generally supportive of ObamaCare , warned last week that these political theories are overly simplistic . '' The oft-heard promise 'we will find out what works and what does not ' scarcely does justice to the complexity of medical practice , `` the Stanford professor wrote . & # 8226 ; Steep declines in choice and quality . This is all of a piece with the hubris of an Administration that thinks it can substitute government planning for market forces in determining where the $ 33 trillion the U.S. will spend on medicine over the next decade should go . This centralized system means above all fewer choices ; what works for the political class must work for everyone . With formerly private insurers converted into public utilities , for instance , they 'll inevitably be banned from selling products like health savings accounts that encourage more cost-conscious decisions . Unnoticed by the press corps , the Congressional Budget Office argued recently that the Senate bill would so `` substantially reduce flexibility in terms of the types , prices , and number of private sellers of health insurance `` that companies like WellPoint might need to `` be considered part of the federal budget. `` With so large a chunk of the economy and medical practice itself in Washington 's hands , quality will decline . Ultimately , `` our capacity to innovate and develop new therapies would suffer most of all , `` as Harvard Medical School Dean Jeffrey Flier recently wrote in our pages . Take the $ 2 billion annual tax & # 8212 ; rising to $ 3 billion in 2018 & # 8212 ; that will be leveled against medical device makers , among the most innovative U.S. industries . Democrats believe that more advanced health technologies like MRI machines and drug-coated stents are driving costs too high , though patients and their physicians might disagree . '' The Senate is n't hearing those of us who are closest to the patient and work in the system every day , `` Brent Eastman , the chairman of the American College of Surgeons , said in a statement for his organization and 18 other speciality societies opposing ObamaCare . For no other reason than ideological animus , doctor-owned hospitals will face harsh new limits on their growth and who they 're allowed to treat . Physician Hospitals of America says that ObamaCare will `` destroy over 200 of America 's best and safest hospitals. `` & # 8226 ; Blowing up the federal fisc . Even though Medicare 's unfunded liabilities are already about 2.6 times larger than the entire U.S. economy in 2008 , Democrats are crowing that ObamaCare will cost `` only `` $ 871 billion over the next decade while fantastically reducing the deficit by $ 132 billion , according to CBO . Yet some 98 % of the total cost comes after 2014 & # 8212 ; remind us why there must absolutely be a vote this week & # 8212 ; and most of the taxes start in 2010 . That includes the payroll tax increase for individuals earning more than $ 200,000 that rose to 0.9 from 0.5 percentage points in Mr. Reid 's final machinations . Job creation , here we come . Other deceptions include a new entitlement for long-term care that starts collecting premiums tomorrow but does n't start paying benefits until late in the decade . But the worst is not accounting for a formula that automatically slashes Medicare payments to doctors by 21.5 % next year and deeper after that . Everyone knows the payment cuts wo n't happen but they remain in the bill to make the cost look lower . The American Medical Association 's priority was eliminating this `` sustainable growth rate `` but all they got in return for their year of ObamaCare cheerleading was a two-month patch snuck into the defense bill that passed over the weekend . The truth is that no one really knows how much ObamaCare will cost because its assumptions on paper are so unrealistic . To hide the cost increases created by other parts of the bill and transfer them onto the federal balance sheet , the Senate sets up government-run `` exchanges `` that will subsidize insurance for those earning up to 400 % of the poverty level , or $ 96,000 for a family of four in 2016 . Supposedly they would only be offered to those whose employers do n't provide insurance or work for small businesses . As Eugene Steuerle of the left-leaning Urban Institute points out , this system would treat two workers with the same total compensation & # 8212 ; whatever the mix of cash wages and benefits & # 8212 ; very differently . Under the Senate bill , someone who earned $ 42,000 would get $ 5,749 from the current tax exclusion for employer-sponsored coverage but $ 12,750 in the exchange . A worker making $ 60,000 would get $ 8,310 in the exchanges but only $ 3,758 in the current system . For this reason Mr. Steuerle concludes that the Senate bill is not just a new health system but also `` a new welfare and tax system `` that will warp the labor market . Given the incentives of these two-tier subsidies , employers with large numbers of lower-wage workers like Wal-Mart may well convert them into `` contractors `` or do more outsourcing . As more and more people flood into `` free `` health care , taxpayer costs will explode . A Reckless Health Care Bill That Nobody Believes In - WSJ.com\""

        "text": "\"There have been so many school shootings over the last 40 years that researchers have been able to develop a profile of the typical mass murderer . They 're called `` active shooters `` or `` active killers `` and their crimes play out in a matter of minutes . After the Columbine High School massacre in 1999 , police changed their tactics . The two student gunmen killed 15 people and themselves before the SWAT team was in position . Commanders realized that it simply takes too long to assemble a tactical team in time to stop an active killer . The new tactics developed in response to Columbine involved creating an ad-hoc tactical team using the first four or five patrol officers on the scene . They would enter the shooting scene in a diamond formation with guns pointing in all directions . This technique was employed by police departments around the country . Then 32 people were killed by a lone gunman at Virginia Tech in April 2007 . Seung Hui Cho shot 47 people , 30 fatally , in the university 's Norris Hall in just 11 minutes . That means every minute he killed more than three people and shot a total of four . Once again , the gunman continued shooting until a four-officer team made entry and then he killed himself . Law enforcement reviewed its tactics . Based on the Virginia Tech data , experts determined the first officer on scene should make entry immediately with an aggressive attack on the shooter . Every minute the officer waits for back-up , another three or more people could die . In other words , while it was once considered suicide for a lone officer to take on an active killer , it is now considered statistical homicide for him not to do so . Tactical Defense Institute in Adams County , Ohio developed one of the first `` single officer response `` programs in the nation . TDI was teaching the tactic even before Virginia Tech . Now the National School Resource Officer Organization ( NSRO ) is using TDI instructors to teach school resource officers how to confront a gunman immediately . Locally , all Blue Ash police officers are trained in these new tactics in large part because their chief , Col. Chris Wallace , is also a TDI instructor . The other statistic that emerged from a study of active killers is that they almost exclusively seek out `` gun free `` zones for their attacks . In most states , concealed handguns are prohibited at schools and on college campuses even for those with permits . Many malls and workplaces also place signs at their entrances prohibiting firearms on the premises . Now tacticians believe the signs themselves may be an invitation to the active killers . The psychological profile of a mass murderer indicates he is looking to inflict the most casualties as quickly as possible . Also , the data show most active killers have no intention of surviving the event . They may select schools and shopping malls because of the large number of defenseless victims and the virtual guarantee no on the scene one is armed . As soon as they 're confronted by any armed resistance , the shooters typically turn the gun on themselves .\""

        "text": "\"A PRACTICAL MAN 'S PROOF OF GOD The existence of God is a subject that has occupied schools of philosophy and theology for thousands of years . Most of the time , these debates have revolved around all kinds of assumptions and definitions . Philosophers will spend a lifetime arguing about the meaning of a word and never really get there . One is reminded of the college student who was asked how his philosophy class was going . He replied that they had not done much because when the teacher tried to call roll , the kids kept arguing about whether they existed or not . Most of us who live and work in the real world do not concern ourselves with such activities . We realize that such discussions may have value and interest in the academic world , but the stress and pressure of day-to-day life forces us to deal with a very pragmatic way of making decisions . If I ask you to prove to me that you have $ 2.00 , you would show it to me . Even in more abstract things we use common sense and practical reasoning . If I ask you whether a certain person is honest or not , you do not flood the air with dissertations on the relative nature of honesty ; you would give me evidence one way or the other . The techniques of much of the philosophical arguments that go on would eliminate most of engineering and technology if they were applied in those fields . The purpose of this brief study is to offer a logical , practical , pragmatic proof of the existence of God from a purely scientific perspective . To do this , we are assuming that we exist , that there is reality , and that the matter of which we are made is real . If you do not believe that you exist , you have bigger problems than this study will entail and you will have to look elsewhere . THE BEGINNING If we do exist , there are only two possible explanations as to how our existence came to be . Either we had a beginning or we did not have a beginning . The Bible says , `` In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth `` ( Genesis 1 :1 ) . The atheist has always maintained that there was no beginning . The idea is that matter has always existed in the form of either matter or energy ; and all that has happened is that matter has been changed from form to form , but it has always been . The Humanist Manifesto says , `` Matter is self-existing and not created , `` and that is a concise statement of the atheist 's belief . The way we decide whether the atheist is correct or not is to see what science has discovered about this question . The picture below on the left represents our part of the cosmos . Each of the disk shaped objects is a galaxy like our Milky Way . All of these galaxies are moving relative to each other . Their movement has a very distinct pattern which causes the distance between the galaxies to get greater with every passing day . If we had three galaxies located at positions A , B. and C in the second diagram below , and if they are located as shown , tomorrow they will be further apart . The triangle they form will be bigger . The day after tomorrow the triangle will be bigger yet . We live in an expanding universe that gets bigger and bigger and bigger with every passing day . Now let us suppose that we made time run backwards ! If we are located at a certain distance today , then yesterday we were closer together . The day before that , we were still closer . Ultimately , where must all the galaxies have been ? At a point ! At the beginning ! At what scientists call a singularity ! A second proof is seen in the energy sources that fuel the cosmos . The picture to the right is a picture of the sun . Like all stars , the sun generates its energy by a nuclear process known as thermonuclear fusion . Every second that passes , the sun compresses 564 million tons of hydrogen into 560 million tons of helium with 4 million tons of matter released as energy . In spite of that tremendous consumption of fuel , the sun has only used up 2 % of the hydrogen it had the day it came into existence . This incredible furnace is not a process confined to the sun . Every star in the sky generates its energy in the same way . Throughout the cosmos there are 25 quintillion stars [ a meaningless number , given that only some of the universe is visible ] , each converting hydrogen into helium , thereby reducing the total amount of hydrogen in the cosmos . Just think about it ! If everywhere in the cosmos hydrogen is being consumed and if the process has been going on forever , how much hydrogen should be left ? Suppose I attempt to drive my automobile without putting any more gas ( fuel ) into it . As I drive and drive , what is eventually going to happen ? I am going to run out of gas I If the cosmos has been here forever , we would have run out of hydrogen long ago ! The fact is , however , that the sun still has 98 % of its original hydrogen . The fact is that hydrogen is the most abundant material in the universe ! Everywhere we look in space we can see the hydrogen 21 cm line in the spectrum_a piece of light only given off by hydrogen . This could not be unless we had a beginning ! A third scientific proof that the atheist is wrong is seen in the second law of thermodynamics . [ Oh , Christ , not this one again ] In any closed system , things tend to become disordered . If an automobile is driven for years and years without repair , for example , it will become so disordered that it would not run any more . Getting old is simple conformity to the second law of thermodynamics . In space , things also get old . Astronomers refer to the aging process as heat death . If the cosmos is `` everything that ever was or is or ever will be , `` as Dr. Carl Sagan is so fond of saying , nothing could be added to it to improve its order or repair it . Even a universe that expands and collapses and expands again forever would die because it would lose light and heat each time it expanded and rebounded . The atheist 's assertion that matter/energy is eternal is scientifically wrong . The biblical assertion that there was a beginning is scientifically correct . THE CAUSE If we know the creation has a beginning , we are faced with another logical question_was the creation caused or was it not caused ? The Bible states , `` In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. `` Not only does the Bible maintain that there was a cause_a creation_but it also tells us what the cause was . It was God . The atheist tells us that `` matter is self-existing and not created. `` If matter had a beginning and yet was uncaused , one must logically maintain that something would have had to come into existence out of nothing . From empty space with no force , no matter , no energy , and no intelligence , matter would have to become existent . Even if this could happen by some strange new process unknown to science today , there is a logical problem . In order for matter to come out of nothing , all of our scientific laws dealing with the conservation of matter/energy would have to be wrong , invalidating all of chemistry [ Physics , XXXXX ] . All of our laws of conservation of angular momentum would have to be wrong , invalidating all of physics . All of our laws of conservation of electric charge would have to be wrong , invalidating all of electronics and demanding that your TV set not work ! ! Your television set may not work , but that is not the reason ! In order to believe matter is uncaused , one has to discard known laws and principles of science . No reasonable person is going to do this simply to maintain a personal atheistic position . The atheist 's assertion that matter is eternal is wrong . The atheist 's assertion that the universe is uncaused and selfexisting is also incorrect . The Bible 's assertion that there was a beginning which was caused is supported strongly by the available scientific evidence . THE DESIGN If we know that the creation had a beginning and we know that the beginning was caused , there is one last question for us to answer -- what was the cause ? The Bible tells us that God was the cause . We are further told that the God who did the causing did so with planning and reason and logic . Romans 1:20 tells us that we can know God is `` through the things he has made. `` The atheist , on the other hand , will try to convince us that we are the product of chance . Julian Huxley once said : \u00c2 \u201c We are as much a product of blind forces as is the falling of a stone to earth or the ebb and flow of the tides . We have just happened , and man was made flesh by a long series of singularly beneficial accidents.\u00c2 \u201d The subject of design has been one that has been explored in many different ways . For most of us , simply looking at our newborn child is enough to rule out chance . There are Modern-day scientists like Paul Davies and Frederick Hoyle , and others , that are raising elaborate objections to the use of chance in explaining natural phenomena . A principle of modern science has emerged in the 1980s called `` the anthropic principle. `` The basic thrust of the anthropic principle is that chance is simply not a valid mechanism to explain the atom or life . If chance is not valid , we are constrained to reject Huxley 's claim and to realize that we are the product of an intelligent God . THE NEXT STEP We have seen a practical proof of God 's existence in this brief study . A flood of questions arise at this point . Which God are we talking about ? Where did God come from ? Why did God create us ? How did God create us ? All of these and many more are answered in the same way_by looking at the evidence in a practical , common sense way .

        "text": "\"SAN FRANCISCO - A federal judge challenged the backers of California 's voter-enacted ban on same-sex marriage Wednesday to explain how allowing gay couples to wed threatens conventional unions , a demand that prompted their lawyer to acknowledge he did not know . The unusual exchange between U.S. District Chief Judge Vaughn Walker and Charles Cooper , a lawyer for the group that sponsored Proposition 8 , came during a hearing on a lawsuit challenging the measure as discriminatory under the U.S. Constitution . Cooper had asked Walker to throw out the suit or make it more difficult for those civil rights claims to prevail . The judge not only refused but signaled that when the case goes to trial in January , he expects Cooper and his legal team to present evidence showing that male-female marriages would be undermined if same-sex marriages were legal . & # 8216 ; Naturally procreative relationships & # 8217 ; The question is relevant to the assertion that Proposition 8 is constitutionally valid because it furthers the states goal of fostering `` naturally procreative relationships , `` Walker explained . '' What is the harm to the procreation purpose you outlined of allowing same-sex couples to get married ? `` Walker asked . '' My answer is , I do n't know . I do n't know , `` Cooper answered . Moment later , after assuring the judge his response did not mean Proposition 8 was doomed to be struck down , Cooper tried to clarify his position . The relevant question was not whether there is proof that same-sex unions jeopardize marriages between men and women , but whether `` the state is entitled , when dealing with radical proposals to make changes to bedrock institutions such as this ... to take a wait and see attitude , `` he said . '' There are things we ca n't know , that 's my point , `` Cooper said . '' The people of California are entitled to step back and let the experiment unfold in Massachusetts and other places , to see whether our concerns about the health of marital unions have either been confirmed or perhaps they have been completely assuaged. `` Walker pressed on , asking again for specific `` adverse consequences `` that could follow expanding marriage to include same-sex couples . Cooper cited a study from the Netherlands , where gay marriage is legal , showing that straight couples were increasingly opting to become domestic partners instead of getting married . '' Has that been harmful to children in the Netherlands ? What is the adverse effect ? `` Walker asked . & # 8216 ; Proof of no harm ? & # 8217 ; Cooper said he did not have the facts at hand . '' But it is not self-evident that there is no chance of any harm , and the people of California are entitled not to take the risk , `` he said . '' Since when do Constitutional rights rest on the proof of no harm ? `` Walker parried , adding the First Amendment right to free speech protects activities that many find offensive , `` but we tolerate those in a free society. `` Walker made clear that he wants to examine other issues that are part of the political rhetoric surrounding same-sex marriage but rarely surface in courtrooms . Among the questions he plans to entertain at the trial are whether sexual orientation is a fixed or immutable characteristic , whether gays are a politically powerful group , and if same-sex marriage bans such as Proposition 8 were motivated by anti-gay bias .\""

The Flash hidder ban has lowered target shooting scores more than protecting lives . 2 ) Magazine limit ? Argued by anti-gunners to save lives . Argued to prevent rapid and large expendature of rounds down range upon victims . True , but how often do you hear that ? When it does happen it is national news . The real threat is from guns that contain more 2 less than 4 bullets : http : //ip.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/2/151 The anti-gunners know this and are comming after your 6 shot revolvers next . They just wanted people to started getting used it to idea of banning bullet capacity . So then . The ban on more than 10 bullets ?

        "text": "\"The Hidden Agenda Behind Gun Storage Laws By David Kopel In Canada and Great Britain deceitful `` safe storage `` laws allow government invasion of gun owners ` homes . These laws are all part of the gun grabbers ` wholesale attack on private gun ownership . Responsible gun owners store their guns safely . For over a century , the National Rifle Association and other civic groups have done everything they can to encourage safe gun storage . Partly as a result , the fatal gun accident rate for both kids and adults has fallen to an all-time low . In spite of this , anti-gun politicians , and the anti-gun groups are working to turn `` safe storage `` into a tool for disarming the American public . Gun owners who think they have nothing to lose from a government takeover of gun storage should look at what has happened in countries such as Canada and Great Britain . There , gun owner apathy has allowed `` safe storage `` to become the platform for abolishing gun ownership for home protection , for invading the privacy and the homes of gun owners , and for attacking even the simple possession of firearms . Great Britain British gun owners have a long tradition of going along with government proposals for `` reasonable `` restrictions on their rights . But as many Britons found out too late , a restriction that appears reasonable on paper may become quite unreasonable in practice . British law merely mandates that guns be stored in `` a secure place. `` But Britain has a national gun licensing system , similar to the American system proposed by Sarah Brady of Handgun Control , Inc. Because most police administrators in Britain are intensely opposed to citizens owning guns , they use the storage law to make acquiring a gun license as onerous as possible . If you want to obtain or renew a gun license in Britain , two police officers will visit your home to scrutinize your gun security system . Although the law , even today , does not order guns to be locked in a safe , the police routinely compel gun owners to purchase safes -- sometimes two safes , the second one for separate storage of ammunition . A person buying a low-powered L5 rimfire rifle may have to spend \u00c2\u00a3100 on a safe . A person with five guns may be ordered to add a \u00c2\u00a31000 electronic security system . One effect of the heavy security costs is to reduce the ability of middle-income or poor people to legally own guns , a goal which has been a constant objective of gun control proponents throughout history . Of course , the requirement that guns be locked in safes makes it nearly impossible for the gun to be used for home protection and the British police establishment despises the idea of defensive gun ownership . If you want to obtain or renew a gun license in Britain , two police officers will visit your home to scrutinize your gun security system . The requirement that gun owners purchase safes was never democratically enacted by the British Parliament . Rather , the requirement was invented by police administrators , who correctly recognized that any system requiring government permission to buy a gun can be manipulated by anti-gun administrators . ( Similarly , in the United States , police administrators have used the Brady Act to deny handgun purchases by thousands of people with unpaid traffic tickets or other trivial offenses . Brady does not formally sanction such abuses , but by requiring government permission for handgun purchases , the Act makes such abuses inevitable . ) Canada In Canada , the Criminal Code prohibits `` careless `` storage of a firearm , and gives the government the authority to create storage regulations . What does this mean in practice ? Consider some cases from 1996 and 1997 : Hearing suspicious sounds , perhaps from a burglar , a husband took his unloaded rifle with him one night when he looked around his house . A few days later , the wife told a friend about the incident . Aghast , the friend called the police . The police arrived at the couple ` s home and bullied their way in . Searching the home , they found the unloaded rifle under a mattress in the bedroom . No children lived in the home . The couple was charged with careless storage of a firearm . A 67-year-old single woman ran a small boarding house in Ontario . A downstairs tenant began harassing and stalking her . Worried that the woman might pose a threat to the tenant , the police searched her apartment and found several unloaded guns in her closets . She was convicted of storage of a firearm in violation of government regulations . She had been attending school and studying to become a paralegal , but her conviction will bar her from a job in the legal field . Recently in Winnipeg , a 72-year-old woman called a hospital to request that a visiting nurse come over and help her with some medication . Someone from the hospital asked if the woman had any firearms in the home . '' Yes , `` she replied , `` my husband has a couple of old hunting rifles down in the rec room. `` The police came over immediately and began searching the home . They found several long guns , each with a trigger lock and locked to a rack in the basement . They also found a .25 caliber pistol locked in a bedroom closet , which they had broken into . The 73-year-old husband came home in the middle of the search , and was immediately handcuffed , and accused of being violent . Other than the fact that he owned guns , there was no evidence that he was violent . ( His neighbors later signed statements saying they had known him for years , and he had always been peaceful . ) Eventually the police removed the handcuffs , and told the man that he had never been under arrest . Gun storage laws sometimes provide a means for police to justify outrageously bad police work . In Medicine Hat , Alberta , a criminal who had charges pending against him tried to buy leniency by claiming that a man named Larry Davies was a marijuana dealer , with over a pound in his house . The Medicine Hat police did nothing to verify the informant ` s claim , other than looking up Larry Davies ` address in the phone book . The SWAT team , apparently having nothing else to do that day , broke into the Davies household , and forced Larry Davies and three friends to the floor , pointing submachine guns at their heads . A search of the house revealed : Mrs. Davies and her newborn baby , who had come home from the hospital that day ; four grams of marijuana ( weighing less than a United States 25-cent piece ) ; and a disassembled FN/FAL rifle in a basement closet . Apparently embarrassed but not repentant about the sloppy police practices and wanton show of force , the government charged Mr. Davies with unsafe storage of a firearm . Happily , a judge threw the charges out of court , noting that whatever Mr. Davies had done was much less of a threat to society than what the police had done . And Canadian courts have sometimes stopped other abusive prosecutions related to gun storage laws . But even then , the victim of the abusive prosecution must spend thousands of dollars in legal fees to avoid a prison sentence of up to two years . As David Tomlinson , President of Canada ` s National Firearms Association , points out , gun storage laws are unenforceable without random police searches of the home . Canada ` s newest gun law , which goes into effect next year , gives the police the authority to `` inspect `` private homes to ensure that gun storage laws are being complied with . Gun storage laws are like laws barring married couples from using birth control : they are unenforceable without massive government intrusions into the sanctity of the home . In 1965 , the United States Supreme Court struck down a birth control ban for this very reason . ( Griswold v. Connecticut , 381 U.S. 479 ( 1965 ) ) . For the same reason , privacy-minded legislators and citizens should reject turning the government into the home gun storage enforcer . Former-President Clinton , by the way , effusively praised the new Canadian gun law ( Bill C-68 ) which authorizes searches without probable cause . SMALL STEPS Gun prohibition almost always moves by incremental steps . Restrictions that would have seemed outrageous if proposed by themselves can appear `` reasonable `` when they merely advance existing restrictions a few more steps . Gun storage laws are . . . unenforceable without massive government intrusions into the sanctity of the home . In Canada , prohibitionists , such as then-Justice Minister Alan Rock , have used gun storage laws as a justification for imposing universal gun registration , since registration `` will create a sense of accountability on the part of the firearms owner to comply with some of the safe storage laws that are in effect. `` As the next step , the anti-gun lobbies in Canada have begun pushing for `` community storage. `` Rather than keeping your guns in a safe in your home , you would have to keep your guns at a police station . When you wanted to use your gun for the day , you could check it out from the police station . The anti-gun groups point out that a gun in the home could be stolen , or could be misused in a domestic incident . There is no reason , they argue , for guns to be kept in a home 365 days a year , when the gun may only be used a few days a year . To counter the anti-gun groups , gun owners in Canada can hardly argue that removing guns from the home makes it impossible to use the guns for home defense . They gave up the moral case for self-defense years ago by arguing that gun ownership was justified for sporting purposes , but not daring to assert that gun ownership is justified for defensive purposes . And by agreeing to `` safe storage `` laws , the Canadian gun owners gave up the practical ability to use a gun for self-defense in a sudden emergency . With so much ground already conceded , Canadian gun owners are reduced to arguing minor points , such as how a centralized gun storage repository might be more vulnerable to theft . Even conceding on the `` community storage `` issue will do gun owners no good . In 1996 , the British Parliament banned almost all handguns , but allowed owners of single-shot .22s to keep the guns locked in central repositories at gun ranges . The new restrictions only briefly sated the appetite of the British anti-gun lobbies . In 1997 , community storage was replaced by its logical consequence , complete prohibition of all handguns . The Future Who can believe that the right to keep and bear arms could survive `` community storage , `` with gun owners needing to ask government bureaucrats for permission to obtain access to their own guns ? Who can believe that the American anti-gun lobbies , who so consistently imitate the programs of their foreign cousins , will not begin demanding community storage , once they have laid the foundation with `` safe storage `` laws ? Storing guns safely is the duty of every gun owner . What makes for safety depends very much on individual circumstances . Safety is , and always has been , the concern of organizations such as the National Rifle Association . In the hands of anti-gun lobbies and government bureaucrats , though , `` safe storage `` becomes an Orwellian term designed to negate the many safety benefits of the right to bear arms . Home safety is the responsibility of the family , not the state .

California alone has 541 numbered statutes of gun law , twice what the federal government has passed . We publish the gun laws for several states , and distribute books on the subject for 24 states . Our definition for a gun law , while slightly different than yours , is close enough and guides our selection -- with a need to include no extraneous material that would increase the girth and cost of our books . If it affects private ownership , possession or use of firearms , it is included . A huge list of laws that are not included , which would raise the counts dramatically , is printed in the front of each of our books ( e.g. , regs for police , criminals , military , Native Americans , federal officials , etc . ; 55 numbered federal statutes deal solely with armed federal agents ) . Gun-law counts are somewhat preposterous though because , for example , a single law can regulate numerous disparate subjects . The Brady law , for example , with its 3,000 words , controls airline baggage , point-of-sale purchases , development and maintenance of an FBI computer gun-tracking system and much more . Counting it as `` one law `` would be hopelessly misleading if the goal is to determine how much gun law exists . For specifics , I can tell you affirmatively that at last count there were 271 numbered federal gun-controlling statutes ; Texas had 226 ; Arizona 183 ; Florida 229 ; and Virginia , in out just released 7th edition , has 193 .

The answer to that is no , and usually there are multiple bans for any nefarious activity you can imagine . New proposals invariable seek to criminalize possession by the public , possession which is perfectly lawful and harms no one , creating victimless crimes , and malum prohibitum laws that reduce freedom . That 's why new bills typically meet such stiff resistance . Is there a mechanism for you to amend your paper for Brookings ?

Since I do not want to misrepresent the theory , I have used an explanation of Darwin 's theory from Gould 's book , `` Full House. `` On page 138 , Gould states : 1 ) All organisms tend to produce more offspring than can possibly survive . 2 ) Offspring vary among themselves , and are not carbon copies of an immutable type . 3 ) This variation is passed down by inheritance to future generations . ( We know that black folks have black kids ; white folks , white kids ; tall parents tend to have tall children ; and so on . ) 4 ) If many offspring must die ( for not all can be accommodated in nature 's limited ecology ) , and individuals in all species vary among themselves , then on average survivors will tend to be those individuals with variations that are fortuitously best suited to changing local environments . Since heredity exists , the offspring of survivors will tend to resemble their successful parents . The accumulation of these favorable variants through time will produce evolutionary change .\""

        "text": "\"Court : Seattle police OK to stun pregnant woman By GENE JOHNSON & # 8232 ; ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER SEATTLE -- Three Seattle police officers were justified when they used a stun gun on a pregnant mother who refused to sign a traffic ticket , a federal appeals court ruled Friday in a case that prompted an incredulous dissent . Malaika Brooks was driving her son to Seattle 's African American Academy in 2004 when she was stopped for doing 32 mph in a school zone . She insisted it was the car in front of her that was speeding , and refused to sign the ticket because she thought she 'd be admitting guilt . Rather than give her the ticket and let her go on her way , the officers decided to arrest her . One reached in , turned off her car and dropped the keys on the floor . Brooks stiffened her arms against the steering wheel and told the officers she was pregnant , but refused to get out , even after they threatened to stun her . The officers - Sgt . Steven Daman , Officer Juan Ornelas and Officer Donald Jones - then stunned her three times , in the thigh , shoulder and neck , and hauled her out of the car , laying her face-down in the street . Brooks gave birth to a healthy baby two months later , but has permanent scars from the Taser . She sued the officers for violating her constitutional rights , and U.S. District Judge Richard Jones allowed the case to continue . He declined to grant the officers immunity for performing their official duties and said Brooks ' rights were clearly violated . But in a 2-1 ruling Friday , a panel of the 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed . Judges Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because Brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest . The use of force was also justified because of the threat Brooks posed , Hall wrote : `` It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment 's notice . Nonetheless , some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained , particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation. `` They also noted that the force used was n't that serious because the Taser was in `` touch `` mode rather than `` dart `` mode , which hurts more . They reversed the lower court 's opinion and held that the officers were entitled to immunity from the lawsuit . The officers ' lawyers , Ted Buck and Karen Cobb , said the officers made the right decision under the circumstances they faced . '' Police officers have to have the ability to compel people to obey their lawful orders , `` Buck said . That 's all the court recognized today . The 9th Circuit just applied the law instead of getting caught up in the otherwise unfortunate factual circumstances. `` The majority 's opinion outraged Judge Marsha Berzon , who called it `` off the wall. `` '' I fail utterly to comprehend how my colleagues are able to conclude that it was objectively reasonable to use any force against Brooks , let alone three activations of a Taser , in response to such a trivial offense , `` she wrote . She argued that under Washington law , the officers had no authority to take Brooks into custody : Failure to sign a traffic infraction is not an arrestable offense , and it 's not illegal to resist an unlawful arrest . Berzon said the majority 's notion that Brooks obstructed officers was so far-fetched that even the officers themselves did n't make that legal argument . To obstruct an officer , one must obstruct the officer 's official duties , and the officers ' only duties in this case were to detain Brooks long enough to identify her , check for warrants , write up the citation and give it to her . Brooks ' failure to sign did not interfere with those duties , she said . Furthermore , Brooks posed no apparent threat , and the officers could not have known how stunning her would affect the fetus , or whether it might prompt premature labor - another reason their actions were inexcusable , Berzon said . Brooks ' lawyer , Eric Zubel , said he would ask the 9th Circuit to rehear the case . '' This is outrageous - that something like this could happen to a pregnant woman , in front of an elementary school , at 8:30 in the morning , to someone who posed no threat whatsoever , `` he said .\""

Bell , which affirmed the constitutionality of forced sterilization of people deemed genetically inferior. . . . in the mid-1800 's . . . the British polymath Sir Francis Galton . . . introduced the idea of intelligence as an inherited trait and . . . developed a science to promote it , which he named eugenics . In America , Galton 's ideas were picked up by the biologist Charles Davenport , who in 1904 established Cold Spring Harbor laboratory on Long Island as a national center for eugenics research and policy planning. . . . Davenport created a Eugenics Records Office and recruited an ambitious young high school teacher named Harry Laughlin to join him in an enormous project that sent fieldworkers across the country to identify the `` germ-plasm `` of unfit family strains so that it could be eradicated . Laughlin became an influential developer of American compulsory sterilization policy , which had officially begun in 1907 when Indiana passed a law allowing scientists to use surgical methods to eradicate the unfit . . . .He helped Congress formulate the 1924 Immigration Act , which kept out `` inferior `` people from Southern and Eastern Europe . Bruinius deftly plays up the contrast between the eugenicists ' obsession with cold measurements of human value and their own messy lives , which were marked by disease and behavior that could have qualified them as unfit : Galton suffered from severe depression ; Davenport had one child who was sickly and another who was apparently dyslexic ; and Laughlin was afflicted with epilepsy . In America and elsewhere , enthusiasm for eugenics was broadly supported by elites . In Britain , people as varied as Winston Churchill and George Bernard Shaw embraced its goals , and there was lively debate about how much the state itself should control reproduction of individuals . Eugenic science especially appealed to Fabian socialists , who saw it as further justification for abolishing class \u00c2\u2014 after all , once the playing field was level the effect of heredity could finally express itself clearly and be studied . In this country , eugenic theory and practice engaged the likes of Theodore Roosevelt , the birth control crusader Margaret Sanger and leaders of the Carnegie and Rockefeller foundations .

No one can deny that after a human being is conceived it will develop into the very same being as those debating this issue . What astounds me is that those who favor abortion went through an identical development stage as the being they are condemning to death . Would these very same people agree that a similiar choice should have been made about their own existence ? Abortion today is used primarily as a birth control of convenience because people are too self-centered to take precautions . They prefer their own pleasurable self-indulgence over the care and sanctity of the life they created . What ever happened to taking responsibility for one 's actions in this country ? Is it too much to ask a woman who has conceived to place the child into adoption ? Nine months of discomfort is nothing compared to life in prison for voluntary manslaughter !

Five of the teens had just left Cody Ninth Grade Academy , where they were taking summer classes , when they were shot at the nearby bus stop . The gunmen exited a vehicle and `` asked for a person by name `` before they `` opened fire at the crowd , `` said Detroit Public Schools Police Chief Roderick Grimes . Detroit Police were looking for two suspects in a green minivan , said spokesman Rod Liggons . The teenagers , four boys and three girls , range in age from 14 to 17 years old , Liggons said . Three of the teens were in critical condition , he said . Another summer school student , 15-year-old Bria Wilson , said she was standing at the bus stop when she heard the gunfire . She said she was facing away from the shooters and ran away after the shots were fired . But she saw a 16-year-old male friend lying on the ground , bleeding . '' They were so close \u00c2\u2014 it almost hit me , `` she said . Schools spokesman Steve Wasko said there was `` nothing that we 're aware of at this time `` linking the shootings with any fight or dispute at the school . He said the shootings happened about 2:15 p.m. , about 15 minutes after summer school students were dismissed for the day . Imam Abdullah El-Amin , who co-owns the Numan Funeral Home near the intersection where the shooting took place , said drug-dealing , prostitution and `` hopelessness `` are common in the area , he said . '' It 's terrible that these things are just laying there , festering , in society \u00c2\u2014 time bombs waiting to happen , `` said El-Amin , a Muslim minister and candidate for Detroit City Council .

The 4-3 vote sent the legislation carried by Assemblywoman Lori Salda\u00c3\u00b1a , D-San Diego , to the Appropriations Committee and likely on to the Senate floor where the final outcome is in doubt , particularly in this election-year atmosphere . The measure has passed the Assembly earlier this month . California law currently allows unloaded handguns to be carried in public . Salda\u00c3\u00b1a\u00c2 \u2019 s measure , Assembly Bill 1934 , is supported by a statewide police chief\u00c2 \u2019 s organization and major gun-control groups . They argue that police are being required to respond to reports of guns , draining resources and creating dangerous situations because authorities have to assume the guns are loaded . This \u00c2 \u201c open carry movement\u00c2 \u201d goes \u00c2 \u201c beyond what\u00c2 \u2019 s safe and what\u00c2 \u2019 s responsible , \u00c2 \u201d Salda\u00c3\u00b1a said . Emeryville Police Chief Ken James added , \u00c2 \u201c Open carry is not just a threat to public safety , it\u00c2 \u2019 s a threat to officers.\u00c2 \u201d Several opponents of the measure countered that they have a constitutional right to bear arms and noted that there have been no police problems directly associated with someone carrying an unloaded weapon in plain sight . Some also contend the legislation would make criminals out of hunters , campers and others who take their weapons along for protection and target shooting . Sen. Rod Wright , D-Inglewood , and a gun owner , defended the right to carry weapons in public as long as they are unloaded . Responding to complaints that the guns intimidate and make people uncomfortable , Wright said he has a tall friend with tattoos who intimidates and makes people uncomfortable . \u00c2 \u201c Are we going to ban him next ? \u00c2 \u201d Wright asked as he voted against the bill . But Sen. Gil Cedillo , D-Los Angeles , said that it is too dangerous to allow \u00c2 \u201c gang-bangers\u00c2 \u201d to openly tote weapons . \u00c2 \u201c There are Second Amendment rights , \u00c2 \u201d he said . \u00c2 \u201c There are also Second Amendment responsibilities , \u00c2 \u201d Cedillo said .\""

This study reports two general observations derived from the maps of nuclear and cytosolic polyadenylated [ poly ( A ) + ] RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides ( nt ) ( long RNAs , lRNAs ) and whole-cell RNAs less than 200 nt ( short RNAs , sRNAs ) over the entire nonrepetitive portion of the human genome . First , the potential biological function of an appreciable portion of long unannotated transcripts is to serve as precursors for sRNAs . Second , these maps reveal three classes of RNAs that have specific genomic localization at gene boundaries . Biological relevance of these classes of RNAs is supported by strong correlation with the expression state of genes they associate with , as well as their syntenic conservation between human and mouse .\""

A new , formal debate would do that , and I 'm willing . I do n't care if it 's me or you who proposes the resolution . I 'd like for it to be along the lines of what was going on in that thread , the teaching of creationism in schools , or faith as it relates to the origination of mankind . In the last debate tournament , they had a time limit of 5 days between posts , and the posters went quicker than that . Even with an unforseen problem which caused a delay , the whole thing went just 33 ? days start to finish . When there is a time limit of days , or hours , it can make things unpredictable because if one person posts early , then any kind of projections about when it will be done can be thrown off . Also , it could make the deadline for you fall on a Friday , which I 'm guessing would be bad for your schedule . My suggestion would be to simply set days of the week ( at midnight ? ) so that if one person posts early , it just gives his opponent that much more time . Is there no way you can post once a week , with your deadline being midnight on Sunday ? If you could do that , my deadline could be Wednesday night . I work sometimes long and unpredictable hours during the week , but I can guarantee after your Sunday post , I 'll have something up by midnight Wednesday . Then you would have untill the following Sunday . You would have 4 days , including two weekend days , to come up with yours , and I would have 3 weekdays . I think that 's more than fair . If you ca n't do that , then we would just have to make it one post for each of us every two weeks . It would take between 2 and 3 months to finish it up . A long time , but I 'm willing to do it . I 'll PM Billsco about judges , it could be a problem . I 'm co-operative , but not suicidal . It 's hard to find anyone who does n't have a pretty strong opinion about this subject . I realize it 's not supposed to matter in determining who best made his/her points , but it easily can . There are several here I just ca n't accept as a judge for this kind of topic .

But the same poll also found that 59 percent of residents surveyed favor putting the issue to a public vote in a ballot measure . The poll found that 37 percent oppose bringing the issue to a citywide vote . The poll also identified significant differences on the same-sex marriage issue along racial lines . But the opposition to gay nuptials by blacks doesn\u00c2 \u2019 t appear to be as strong as local gay marriage opponents have predicted . An overwhelming 83 percent of whites responding to the poll said they favor legalizing same-sex marriage , while 12 percent oppose it . A bare majority of 51 percent of blacks said they oppose legalizing gay marriage in the District ; 37 percent polled said they support it . According to the survey , 4 percent of whites and 12 percent of blacks said they had no opinion on the issue . Although the poll\u00c2 \u2019 s finding that an overall majority of 56 percent support legalized same-sex marriage at this time , LGBT activists familiar with ballot measures on the issue in other states could view the D.C. poll results with caution . In a number of states , including California , voter support for same-sex marriage dropped sharply following well funded and what LGBT activists called highly negative campaigns waged by same-sex marriage opponents . Voter initiatives or referenda seeking to prohibit same-sex marriage have won in every state where they\u00c2 \u2019 ve been placed on the ballot . In D.C. , a 1978 law barring ballot measures that would result in discrimination against minorities protected by the city\u00c2 \u2019 s Human Rights Act has so far prevented local opponents of same-sex marriage from putting the issue up for a public vote . The opponents have vowed to continue to challenge city rulings against a marriage ballot measure in court . The Post poll shows that white and black voters differ sharply over whether to bring the gay marriage question to a public vote . Among blacks , 70 percent responding to the poll favor holding a citywide vote on the issue , while 25 percent say a ballot measure should not be held . Six percent had no opinion . Among whites , 58 percent opposed bringing the gay marriage issue to a public vote ; 39 percent favored such a vote . Three percent had no opinion . The Post\u00c2 \u2019 s poll included responses from 1,135 adults reached by either landline or cell phone during Jan. 24-28 . The paper says the poll has a 3 percent margin of error .\""

Obstructed labor can kill the mother , too , or crush her bladder , uterus and vagina between her pelvic bones and the baby\u00c2 \u2019 s skull .

        "text": "\"I personally think conservatives undermine their stated adherence to originalism with their moral opposition to abortion influencing their legal thinking with the `` it 's not in the Constitution `` position . This position is in opposition to the maxim that the Bill of Rights is not the exhaustive listing of the citizen 's rights and is a fruition of the Federalist 's fears and warnings about the dangerousness of trying to list rights . Conservative opposition to Roe and abortion rights in general belie their supposed allegiance to the concept of a government with strictly limited powers -- for saying that a unenumerated right does not exist where no power is conferred to act in that arena is stating that no limits on government 's power exist . . . That government power shall fill the void , not liberty . Scalia 's error in Heller was trying to explain the 2nd as a historical entity instead of explaining SCOTUS 's application of the Amendment in prior cases . Heller neither stated or established anything new ; there never was a `` state `` or `` collective `` right aspect to the 2nd . . . It was always interpreted by SCOTUS to be an individual right exercisable , claimable and enforceable by individuals separately from any militia connection . I just wish Scalia had restated and relied on SCOTUS 's prior holdings that the right is not created , granted or otherwise established by the Amendment so the right is not dependent in any manner upon the words of the Amendment . . . Why he engaged in the linguistic analysis I 'll never know or understand . Is there a point here ? Did n't the dissenting Justices all agree that the right is an individual right , claimable and enforceable by individuals ? It is clear the Stevens dissent was focused on a misreading of Miller 's holding and his just for gun rights metamorphosis supporting the illegitimate assumption that the government can exercise vast unspecified and unenumerated powers just because it feels like it . In Heller Stevens abandons his belief in Roe 's `` prenumbra `` theory , that the Bill of Rights is just a rough outline of liberty interests that stand as examples of many others . I endorse Justice Harlan 's dissent in Poe without Stevens ' recent equivocation and find it to be a compelling argument in constitutional interpretation , since elevated to the opinion of the Court in a case which Stevens concurred : `` Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects . See U.S . Const. , Amdt . 9 . As the second Justice Harlan recognized : ' [ T ] he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause can not be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution . This ` liberty\u00c2\u00b4 is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property ; the freedom of speech , press , and religion ; the right to keep and bear arms ; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures ; and so on . It is a rational continuum which , broadly speaking , includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints , . . . and which also recognizes , what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must , that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment . ' '' Casey v. Planned Parenthood , 505 U.S. 833 , 848 ( 1992 ) This famous exposition is a long standing favorite of Stevens . He cited it in his dissent in Albright v. Oliver , 510 U.S. 266 , 306-07 ( 1994 ) . But he abandons his relationship with these ideals in Heller ? Give me a break . . . Who 's sacrificing his principles for policy ? At least Scalia 's error results in an outcome that is consistent with his fundamental beliefs . That can not be said for Stevens . Just for info sake , Harlan 's dissent is also quoted in the plurality ( Stevens concurring ) in Moore v. City of East Cleveland , 431 U.S. 494 , 502 ( 1977 ) , it was originally written by Justice Harlan in his dissent in Poe v. Ullman , 367 U.S. 497 , 543 ( 1961 ) And if that was the accepted rule for Constitutional interpretation we would still have Jim Crow and the 14th Amendment would be as useful as the 3rd .

This time it 's the proposed `` Regulatory Czar `` who will be coming to a vote this week in the U.S. Senate . His name is Cass Sunstein , and he holds some of the kookiest views you will ever hear . For starters , Sunstein believes in regulating hunting out of existence . He told a Harvard audience in 2007 that `` we ought to ban hunting. `` And in The Rights of Animals : A Very Short Primer ( 2002 ) , he said : I think we should go further ... the law should impose further regulation on hunting , scientific experiments , entertainment , and ( above all ) farming to ensure against unnecessary animal suffering . It is easy to imagine a set of initiatives that would do a great deal here , and indeed European nations have moved in just this direction . There are many possibilities . If that 's all Sunstein believed , he would be dangerous and extreme , but not necessarily kooky . Unfortunately , when you look at WHY he wants to restrict hunting , this is where he goes beyond extreme . In Sunstein 's world , animals should have just as many rights as people ... and they should be able to sue humans in court ! '' We could even grant animals a right to bring suit without insisting that animals are persons , or that they are not property , `` Sunstein said on page 11 of Animal Rights : Current Debates and New Directions ( 2004 ) . Well , that 's a relief ... he is at least willing to concede that animals are not persons ! But he would still have animals suing humans , apparently , with more enlightened humans representing the cuddly critters . Imagine returning from a successful hunting trip ... only to find out that you 've been subpoenaed for killing your prize . Who knows , maybe Sunstein would have the family of the dead animal serving as witnesses in court ! By the way , if you 're wondering what he thinks about the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms , you wo n't be surprised to know that Sunstein is a huge supporter of gun control . In Radicals in Robes : Why Extreme Right-Wing Courts are Wrong for America ( 2005 ) , Sunstein says : Almost all gun control legislation is constitutionally fine .... [ O ] n the Constitution 's text , fundamentalists [ that is , gun rights supporters ] should not be so confident in their enthusiasm for invalidating gun control legislation . Hmm , what part of `` shall not be infringed `` does Sunstein not understand ? Imagine the power that Sunstein could have as the Regulatory Czar -- the nickname for the person heading the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs ( OIRA ) in the White House . As the Regulatory Czar , he could bring about changes in the regulations that affect hunting , gun control and farming . In short , he could make your life hell . Senator Saxby Chambliss ( R-GA ) objected to his nomination several weeks ago , preventing him from being unanimously confirmed . That means that the Senate will now need to garner 60 votes to confirm this radical , kooky choice to the OIRA . No doubt , many of the people our President wants to associate with are radical kooks . First , there was the Rev . Jeremiah Wright ... then there was the self-avowed communist ( Van Jones ) who was nominated for the Green Jobs Czar ... now , there 's an extreme animal rights activist who wants to take away our guns and get Bambi to sue us in court . It 's time to take a STRONG STAND against this radical administration . ]\""

        "text": "\"Sunday , July 26 , 2009 Legal immunity set for swine flu vaccine makers : What are the implications ? AP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe got a swine flu vaccine scoop -- yet the news is four weeks old . It turns out that DHHS Secretary Sibelius has not only given immunity to the makers of Tamiflu and Relenza for injuries stemming from their use against swine flu . She also granted immunity to future swine flu vaccines and `` any associated adjuvants , `` which was published in the June 25 , 2009 Federal Register . Here is the start of his story : The last time the government embarked on a major vaccine campaign against a new swine flu , thousands filed claims contending they suffered side effects from the shots . This time , the government has already taken steps to head that off . Vaccine makers and federal officials will be immune from lawsuits that result from any new swine flu vaccine , under a document signed by Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius , government health officials said Friday . Since the 1980s , the government has protected vaccine makers against lawsuits over the use of childhood vaccines . Instead , a federal court handles claims and decides who will be paid from a special fund . The document signed by Sebelius last month grants immunity to those making a swine flu vaccine , under the provisions of a 2006 law for public health emergencies . It allows for a compensation fund , if needed ... However , the compensation issue is more difficult than portrayed by Stobbe . The special vaccine court to which Stobbe refers applies only to specially designated vaccines , excludes most adult vaccines , and swine flu is not a designated vaccine for which compensation can be paid . The 2006 Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act ( PREPA ) allows the DHHS Secretary to invoke almost complete immunity from liability for manufacturers of vaccines and drugs used to combat a declared public health emergency . PREPA removes the right to a jury trial for persons injured by a covered vaccine , unless a plaintiff can provide clear evidence of willful misconduct that resulted in death or serious physical injury , and gets permission to sue from the DHHS Secretary . There has been no government funding of its potential compensation mechanism , to date . Furthermore , a PREPA declaration explicitly shields `` government program planners `` who arranged for the liability waiver . Pharmaceutical companies making swine flu vaccine today may have demanded immunity from liability before agreeing to begin a crash program to manufacture H1N1 vaccine for the government . According to a 1978 report by the National Academy of Sciences , something similar happened with the 1976 swine flu program : ... all manufacturers made plain that they would not insure themselves , not even temporarily . Instead they put off plans to bottle their vaccine ; pending legislation they would keep the stuff in bulk . Each week\u00c2 \u2019 s delay in moving from bulk to bottles assured at least as much delay in starting inoculations . Thus ended hopes of immunizing anybody in July or even August ... Behind Merrell\u00c2 \u2019 s firmness , there almost certainly was fear of the intentions of the casualty insurers . In May it was no secret that at least some major firms wanted to steer clear of swine vaccine . As early as April 8 Merck had been warned by its primary insurer that coverage for swine vaccine was \u00c2 \u201c considered\u00c2 \u201d not \u00c2 \u201c feasible \u00c2\u2026 at virtually any price.\u00c2 \u201d So Merck 's President had written Mathews and everyone else in sight . Merrell , then about to switch insurers ( for unrelated reasons ) is reported to have been told by its new one something of the same sort at about the same time . We do not know precisely what was made of this , where in Merrell\u00c2 \u2019 s management . We do know that the issue was reviewed again , in June , by the insurer with the same result , a \u00c2 \u201c no.\u00c2 \u201d But we assume that Merrell\u00c2 \u2019 s counsel knew in May what the insurer had already warned in April . However that may be , it shortly would turn out that all insurers saw the swine flu program much alike : not for them . Here is the problem : once the PREP Act is invoked to shield manufacturers from liability , the pharmaceutical firms have no financial incentive to make the safest product , and have a negative incentive to test it for safety . As long as they do not deliberately harm consumers of the product , they will not be liable for damages . Are you following this argument closely ? In order to avoid having prior knowledge of possible harm to users of the product , for which they could be found liable , it is in the manufacturers ' best interest to know as little as possible about adverse reactions caused by their product .

They chose to focus a lot on the role handguns could play in defending house and home against criminals , but seemed to have no problem with a ban on machine guns- the kind of guns that would logically seem to be most protected by the Second Amendment because of their usefulness in military conflicts which would make them a better deterrent against tyranny than other types of firearms .

Miseta [ 10 ] suggested the idea of an intimate relationship between molecules , the intermediates of glucose degradation , as precursors of precursor amino acids , and the organisation of the genetic code . This observation is also analysed by Taylor and Coates [ 11 ] who showed the relationship between the glycolytic pathway , the citric acid cycle , the biosyntheses of amino acids and the genetic code ( Fig . 1 ) and , in particular , they point out that ( i ) all the amino acids that are members of a biosynthetic family tend to have codons with the same first base ( Fig . 1 ) and ( ii ) that the five amino acids codified by GNN codons are found in four biosynthetic pathways close to or at the beginning of the pathway head ( Fig . 1 ) [ 11 ] . More recently , Davis [ 12,13 ] has provided evidence that tRNAs descending from a common ancestor were adaptors of amino acids synthesised by a common precursor and he also discusses the biosynthetic families of amino acids , suggesting their importance in genetic code origin .\""

We had light and dark moths before the industrial revolution , we now still have light and dark moths . The only thing that has changed is the population ratio , assumably by * natural selection * . Natural selection is not proof of evolution by any means . Creationists recognise it and accept it as it goes in nicely with the creationary model . Natural selection is basically the death of a particular type of animal if they are unsuited to the environment . In a given environment ( e.g . a very cold region ) , some ( e.g . the long-haired dogs ) will be more likely to survive , and so pass on their information , than others . Natural selection can favour some sets of information above others , and can eliminate some of the existing information in the population , but it ca n't create any new information . An example , consider the cold environment mentioned above . We take a population of both long , short and medium , haired dogs to this environment . Over time , very short time , the population will only consist of the long haired dogs as the short and medium haired dogs would freeze and be wiped out by the cold conditions . So , as a result , the population as a whole has lost the information for making short haired dogs and has not gained any new information . What did we have when we first took the dogs to the environment ? Dogs ( varying in hair sizes ) . What did we get after a short amount of time ? Dogs ( only the long hair size ) . There is no evolution occuring here , we had dogs before , dogs after . The only difference is that the gene for making short hair has been eradicated from the population by natural selection -- that is it . This is the essense of natural selection - and goes in nicely with the Biblical account of our origins , i.e . variation within a kind and that kind 's have the ability to only lose information - not gain it . So even if the peppered moth case was really true , and not a fraud , it still would not be evidence for evolution as opposed to creation . Anyone who says other wise , does not really know what they are talking about unless new genetic information is somehow being added to the moth 's total DNA content , i.e . their genome , in which case you might have a point . Would any creationists like to challenge anything about this article or the concept ? His method appears to be good , i.e . using observations and experimental data , as well as repeatability . He is using the scientific method ( in reverse as he is collecting the observations and experimental data and then will draw a conclusion based on the evidence and possibly his own bias .

Now , if underneath all this the genome was rock-solid and invariant , you would be correct : organisms would adapt epigenetically and that would be the end of it . However , genetic variation does occur . And once you admit the possibility of genetic variation , the genomic gaps between species cease to be an insurmountable problem for evolution : we can envisage that gap narrowing as we move back in time to a point where two species were one . Genetic adaptation , unlike epigenetic adaptation , does not lie within the individual ; it is distributed across the gene-pool . Mating produces new combinations , and selective environments can enable some combinations to flourish better than others , even once volitional and epigenetic adaptation is taken into account . It 's a mistake to characterise the ToE as being only about RM+NS . Even just in terms of genes , recombination through breeding is very important . But genetic variation does require an explanation , as does the remarkable correlation between the genetic and phylogenetic trees and the fossil record . Besides , genetic adaptation is observed to occur . So far , there 's no evidence that the direction genetic variation takes is under the control of the organism - whatever other adaptive tools might be at its disposal .

Believers include the rest , whose belief ranges from merely an intellectual assent that someone or something is out there to those like Lewis , Augustine , Tolstoy , and Pascal who have had a life-transforming experience after which their faith becomes the primary motivating and organizing principle of their lives . Freud came down clearly and strongly against the notion that there is `` Anyone `` out there . He described his worldview as secular and called it `` scientific , `` and he claimed that no source of knowledge of the universe exists other than `` carefully scrutinized observation what we call research. `` Therefore no knowledge , he said , can be derived from revelation or from intuition . He stated that the notion of the universe created by a being `` resembling a man but magnified in every respect , an idealized superman , reflects the gross ignorance of primitive peoples. `` He stated that no intelligent person could accept the absurdities of the religious worldview . Freud described the concept of God as merely a projection of the childish wish for the protection of an all-powerful father . He added that `` religion is an attempt to master the sensory world in which we are situated by means of the wishful world which we have developed within us as a result of biological and psychological abnormality. `` He concluded that the religious view is `` so pathetically absurd and . . . infantile that it is humiliating and embarrassing to think that the majority of people will never rise above it. `` Except for the brief time as a college student under the influence of a brilliant philosopher named Franz Bratano , a devout believer , when Freud wavered in his atheism , he stated that he remained an unbeliever all of his life . A year before he died , Freud wrote to Charles Sanger , `` Neither in my private life nor in my writing have I ever made a secret of being an out-and-out unbeliever. `` When we carefully assess the record , however , we find that Freud may not have been quite as adamant in his atheism as he proclaimed . Certainly he did refer to himself often as , `` an infidel Jew , `` and he rejected outright the religious view of the universe , especially the Judeo-Christian view . He certainly attacked this view with all his intellectual might and from every possible perspective . Yet , for some reason he remained preoccupied with these issues ; he just could not leave them alone . He spent the last thirty years of his life writing about them . In an autobiographical study he said that these philosophical and religious issues interested him throughout his life from early youth . A great deal of evidence exists that Freud 's worldview proved less than comfortable for him . Faith was by no means a closed issue for him , and he was extremely ambivalent about God 's existence . Anna Freud , Sigmund 's daughter who died a few years ago , explained to me the only way to know her father : `` Do n't read his biographies ; `` she instructed , `` read his letters. `` Throughout Freud 's letters are statements such as , `` If someday we meet above , `` `` [ my ] one , quite secret prayer , `` and statements about God 's grace . During the last thirty years of Freud 's life , he carried out a continuous exchange of hundreds of letters with a Swiss theologian , Oskar Phister . It 's interesting to note that his longest correspondence was with this theologian . He admired Phister and wrote , `` You are a true servant of God . . . [ who ] feels the need to do spiritual good to everyone he meets . You did good this way even to me. `` He later said that Phister was , `` In the fortunate position of being able to lead men to God. `` Source : : Click Here Armand M.

        "text": "\"Research Shows Gay Marriage Reduces VD An associate professor in the Department of Economics at Swarthmore College has written a paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research that shows how in Europe , where same-sex relationships have been granted legal recognition since 1989 ( beginning in Denmark ) , there is a correlation between same-sex marriage ( or civil unions ) and a decline in the rate of at least one sexually transmitted disease , syphilis . In `` Forsaking All Others ? The Effects of 'Gay Marriage ' on Risky Sex , `` Thomas S. Dee writes : One of the conjectured benefits of establishing the legal recognition of same sex partnerships is that it would promote a culture of responsibility and commitment among homosexuals . A specific implication of this claim is that \u00c2 \u201c gay marriage\u00c2 \u201d will reduce the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections ( STI ) . In this study , I present a simple 2-period model , which provides a framework for discussing the ways in which gay marriage might reduce ( or increase ) the prevalence of STI . Then , I present reduced-form empirical evidence on whether gay marriage has actually reduced STI rates . These evaluations are based on country-level panel data from Europe , where nations began introducing national recognition of same-sex partnerships in 1989 . The results suggest that these gay marriage laws led to statistically significant reductions in syphilis rates . However , these effects were smaller and statistically imprecise with respect to gonorrhea and HIV . [ from the paper 's abstract ] Professor Dee is no neophyte or quirky economist working on a pet project . He has contributed articles to numerous academic journals and chapters to several books , including No Child Left Behind ? : The Politics and Practice of School Accountability , Developments in School Finance , and An Economic Analysis of Risky Behavior Among Youths . Dee 's concluding paragraph suggests the impact on both the U.S. economy and public health that could ensue from legalizing gay relationships : These results suggest that gay marriage might reduce , perhaps dramatically , the social costs associated with STI like syphilis . In the United States , over 34,000 cases of 25 syphilis were reported in 2003 ( CDC 2004b ) . And the direct and indirect annual costs of syphilis have been estimated at nearly $ 1 billion , which reflects in large part , the role that syphilis plays in spreading HIV ( CDC 1999 ) . However , the policy relevance of these results probably extends beyond the issue of improvements in public health . For many who are debating the desirability of gay marriage , these results may be more important because of what they suggest about the likely effects of gay marriage on the degree of personal commitment in same-sex relationships . The full paper provides extensive economic analysis , including charts and graphs , and is worth reading for all those concerned about the prospect of equal-marriage rights in the United States -- whether proponents or opponents of the concept . http : //ricksincerethoughts.blogspot .... educes-vd.html\""

Many of the details of the research that ruled out Lamarckianism are no longer taught to Biology undergrads because the old controversies are no longer in the slightest bit controversial , and the field has moved on to much more interesting debates . The students are simply taught that Lamarckianism is an egregiously failed concept . Back in the 1890 's August Weismann and Herbert Spencer argued at length over the possibility of Lamarckian evolution ( Spencer for , Weismann against ) . Supporters of Herbert Spencer , notably the paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn , realized that this issue could only be settled experimentally , so he and his colleagues called for an institute to be set up to run the appropriate experiments . This ultimately lead to the Station for Experimental Evolution at Cold Spring Harbor in New York , and it also persuaded a lot of biologists of all stripes to research the controversy and run experiments . Ultimately this all came to naught after 15-30 years because even the most ardent supporters of Lamarckian evolution recognized that they had had no successes in demonstrating Lamarckian evolution For example , Bumpus 's four famous studies failed to detect any self-adaptation in transplanted stocks of animals . Specifically , Bumpus ( 1898 ) found increased variation but no beneficial self-adaptation in stocks of birds transplanted to new habitats where they lacked their previous heavy predation . In a subsequent study he transplanted both groups ( the old original and the more diverse offshoot group ) to a third location , and showed that each group continued true to type , notably including the higher variation of the group that had been released from heavy predation loads . This showed that the initial change had been evolutionary in nature , and that the creatures were unable to quickly modify themselves to a new ideal . .......... Starting around 1909 , Francis Sumner was able to produce different development of traits in originally identical Peromyscus mice that were reared under highly dissimilar conditions . He even thought for a while that he had showed a degree of inheritance of these acquired characteristics . However , he realized after a long while ( 1932 ) that his results were unltimately far more easily explained as a result of mendelian genetics . All this and much more were viewed as absolutely devastating to the Neo-Lamarckian cause , and the whole field was transformed and replaced by the advent of the neo-Darwinian synthesis , as Fisher and Wright and others demonstrated how natural selection was consistent with mendelian genetics , and how the Cold Spring Harbor work was so much more easily understood by reference to Mendelian genetics . However , the effort to demonstrate Lamarckianism by carefully designed and cleanly performed experiments set an extremely important and beneficial standard for experimental biology thereafter .\""

During times of limited food availability search time may be lengthened , thus increasing prey vulnerability to predation ( Anholt and Werner 1998 ) .

After carrying out the killings the inmates would return to their cells , the Attorney General 's Office said in a revelation that was shocking even for a country wearied by years of drug violence and corruption . '' According to witnesses , the inmates were allowed to leave with authorization of the prison director ... to carry out instructions for revenge attacks using official vehicles and using guards ' weapons for executions , `` office spokesman Ricardo Najera said at a news conference . The director of the prison in Gomez Palacio in Durango state and three other officials were placed under a form of house arrest pending further investigation . No charges have yet been filed . Prosecutors said the prison-based hit squad is suspected in three mass shootings , including the July 18 attack on a party in the city of Torreon , which is near Gomez Palacio . In that incident , gunmen fired indiscriminately into a crowd of mainly young people in a rented hall , killing 17 people , including women . Police found more than 120 bullet casings at the scene , and Najera said tests matched those casings to four assault rifles assigned to guards at the prison . Similar ballistics tests linked the guns to earlier killings at two bars in Torreon , the capital of northern Coahuila state , he said . At least 16 people were killed in those attacks on Feb. 1 and May 15 , local media reported . Najera blamed the killings on disputes between rival drug cartels . '' Unfortunately , the criminals also carried out cowardly killings of innocent civilians , only to return to their cells , `` he said . Coahuila and neighboring Durango are among several northern states that have seen a spike in drug-related violence that authorities attribute to a fight between the Gulf cartel and its former enforcers , known as the Zetas . Mexico has long had a problem with investigating crimes , catching criminals and convicting people . Reports estimate less than 2 percent of crimes in Mexico result in prison sentences . But Sunday 's revelation suggests that even putting cartel gunmen in prison may not prevent them from continuing to commit crimes . Interior Secretary Francisco Blake said the revelation `` can only be seen as a wake-up call for authorities to address , once again , the state of deterioration in many local law enforcement institutions ... we can not allow this kind of thing to happen again. `` Also Sunday , Mexican federal police announced the arrest of an alleged leading member of a drug gang blamed in recent killings and a car-bombing in the violence-ridden border city of Ciudad Juarez , across from El Paso , Texas . Police described Luis Vazquez Barragan , 39 , as a top member of La Linea gang , the enforcement arm of the Juarez cartel , saying he received orders directly from cartel boss Vicente Carrillo Fuentes . Vazquez Barragan allegedly organized payments , moved drugs and oversaw a system of safe houses in and around Ciudad Juarez . Police said he held the same rank as fugitive gang leader Juan Pablo Ledezma , though Vazquez Barragan is not named on reward or most-wanted lists published by the Attorney General 's Office , as Ledezma is . La Linea has been blamed for a car bomb that killed three people July 15 in Ciudad Juarez and for two separate shootings March 13 that killed a U.S. consular employee and two other people connected to the consulate . Police did not say when they caught Vazquez Barragan , but he was allegedly in possession of about a half-kilogram ( pound ) of cocaine and two guns . His arrest led to a raid on a safe house where authorities detained four suspects and freed a kidnap victim . Also Sunday , the Attorney General 's Office said soldiers on patrol in Ciudad Madero in the border state of Tamaulipas seized an arsenal of about three dozen guns , 17 grenades and thousands of bullets in a house . Elsewhere in Tamaulipas , police and prosecutors raided a lot full of truck-pulled tankers in the border city of Reynosa and seized two loaded with oil of a type sometimes stolen from the pipelines of the state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos . Nore than a dozen other tankers and freight containers were also seized . Mexican drug cartels have allegedly become involved in increasingly sophisticated thefts of fuel and oil from Mexico 's pipelines . In the Pacific coast state of Guerrero , authorities reported Sunday they had found the bullet-ridden bodies of six men dumped in various locations , including three in or around the resort of Acapulco . Two of the dead men were identified as people kidnapped earlier in the month .\""

        "text": "\"So how do creationists account for this : ERVs in humans match those in apes . ERV = useless code in DNA , but present in all members of a species Basically it goes like this . Viruses inject their DNA into the hosts DNA . This means that if the cell is able to replicate itself , it also replicates the viral DNA . As we all accept , creationists as well , sometimes things go wrong during this replication process . Sometimes , the viral DNA is rendered inactive . This is inconsequential as the cell dies and the error dies with it . But sometimes , this can happen to sperm cells that just happen to end up fertilizing . Therefore , the organism that is born from the fertilized egg carries this viral error ( ERV ) permanently and then passes it on . Since we can sequence viral DNA and have sequenced the entire human genome , we can go hunting for these viral sequences that have actually been propagating for millions of years . This is testable , every human on the planet has the same ERV 's each of which has resulted from a SINGLE little virus doing its thing at some point in our evolutionary history . For evolution to be false , and this is a golden opportunity for creationists to prove it false , you would have to see that in apes none of these ERVs are present and they would have their own unique set of ERVs . When we looked , we found them and in the exact right place out of billions of sequences . The only way this can currently be explained is with evolution . We have the same error in our DNA that all apes have . Each of these errors has a cause that we can trace to a single event .

I will give my thoughts on all of your points soon , for now , I am just leaving , so I will just inquire as to what you mean on part of your post . Specifically , the following : The WMD analogy is poor . You will not find any vendors . Please find another one . There may be Constitutionally poor arguments in favor of banning WMDs for civilians , that argument is moot . You will not find any vendor . The Constitution protects my right to own arms . That does not mean arms vendors must be forced to sell thier product to me if I want one . That argument is moot . So , what you are saying , is there is no constitutional protection given to the manufacturer of weapons . That is , it would be constitutional to ban the manufacture of guns ? If so , would it still be OK , for an American citizen to buy any weapon that they would want from a foreign government/manufacturere , etc ? Again , thank you for your response . -Dan\""

When I use the word evolution , I am not referring to the minor variations found in all of the various life forms ( microevolution ) . I am referring to the general theory of evolution , correct me if I 'm wrong , which believes these five major events took place without God : 1 . Time , space , and matter came into existence by themselves . 2 . Planets and stars formed from space dust . 3 . Matter created life by itself . 4 . Early life forms learned to reproduce themselves . 5 . Major changes occurred between these diverse life forms ( i.e. , fish changed to amphibians , amphibians changed to reptiles , and reptiles changed to birds or mammals ) . Now here are the six main areas of evolution that we will be able to discuss : 1 . Cosmic evolution-the origin of time , space , and matter . Big Bang . 2 . Chemical evolution-the origin of higher elements from hydrogen . 3 . Stellar and planetary evolution-Origin of stars and planets . 4 . Organic evolution-Origin of life from inanimate matter . 5 . Macroevolution-Changing from one kind into another . 6 . Microevolution-Variations within kinds . Only this one has been observed . So there are some standards I guess you could say , sorry for lack of a better word but it has been a long day and my vocabulary is n't as sharp as it use to be . Correct me if I 'm misinformed or incorrect about any of my above statements concerning my understanding of evolution . Anyways I just wanted to add that real quick before I headed off to bed , and hopefully I will have those questions answered for you by tomorrow . Night .......\""

        "text": "\"5 , By L. LEWIS WALL MOTHERHOOD is a blessing , but in many parts of the world childbirth leaves women permanently injured and turns them into social outcasts . In West Africa , only about 1 percent of pregnant women have Caesarean deliveries because the procedure isn\u00c2 \u2019 t widely available . When labor is obstructed , the baby is trapped in the pelvis , and labor can last up to a week . Women who survive this ordeal can develop a hole in the bladder called a fistula . This injury \u00c2\u2014 caused by the prolonged pressure of the baby\u00c2 \u2019 s head on the soft tissues of the pelvis \u00c2\u2014 causes continuous and uncontrollable loss of urine . The millions of women in Africa and Asia who suffer from fistulas are often shunned by their communities for the rest of their lives . In Liberia , I operated on a woman who had endured a fistula for 35 years , and it took only 20 minutes to repair her injury . Including a month of hospital care and the surgical supplies needed , the operation costs about $ 300 to $ 450 . All a clinic needs is spinal anesthesia , intravenous fluids , basic surgical instruments , sutures and a catheter for draining urine . It\u00c2 \u2019 s even easier to prevent these injuries from happening in the first place . With supervision , local village \u00c2 \u201c labor monitors\u00c2 \u201d can learn to track the progress of a birth and send the woman to a hospital when labor lasts too long . Trained birth attendants can detect abnormalities in labor by using a partograph \u00c2\u2014 a simple graph that charts the progress of labor and tells attendants when to intervene . The World Health Organization tested the partograph in 35,000 births in Southeast Asia and found that using it cut the number of prolonged labors almost by half . Widespread use of this simple early warning system would go a long way toward saving babies\u00c2 \u2019 and mothers\u00c2 \u2019 lives \u00c2\u2014 and making fistulas a thing of the past .\""

        "text": "\"Reading the opinions in McDonald v. Chicago , you might think it was as much a civil-rights case as a gun case . In the ruling , the Supreme Court decided 5\u00c2\u20134 that the Second Amendment applies to states and localities , not just the federal government , and struck down Chicago\u00c2 \u2019 s handgun ban . The four conservative justices , along with Justice Anthony Kennedy , formed the majority . One of the conservatives , Clarence Thomas , also filed a concurring opinion . The main disagreement betwee the two opinions concerned whether the Fourteenth Amendment\u00c2 \u2019 s \u00c2 \u201c privileges or immunities\u00c2 \u201d clause or its \u00c2 \u201c due process\u00c2 \u201d clause is the best way for the Court to apply constitutional protections to state and local governments . But in the process of making their arguments , both opinions emphasize the racial history of the Fourteenth Amendment \u00c2\u2014 the story of the post\u00c2\u2013Civil War South and the federal government\u00c2 \u2019 s crusade to ensure fair treatment for blacks therein . The heart of the problem was that , in an effort to stave off rebellion and maintain the racial caste structure that had developed under slavery , state and local governments refused to respect freedmen\u00c2 \u2019 s constitutional rights . Crucial to the South\u00c2 \u2019 s efforts were gun-control laws that applied to blacks and blacks alone . This does not show that modern gun controllers are racist , or even that the modern gun-control movement has \u00c2 \u201c racist roots , \u00c2 \u201d as some have suggested \u00c2\u2014 the concerns that motivate Sarah Brady are neither the same as nor descended from the concerns that motivated racist southern governments . But this does show that when a government has the ability to forbid gun ownership , it has the ability to render groups it dislikes helpless to defend themselves . Regardless of whether modern gun control accomplishes its purpose of reducing crime \u00c2\u2014 and for the record , there is no evidence it does \u00c2\u2014 a free society should fear a government with such power . The South\u00c2 \u2019 s campaign against black gun ownership , not surprisingly , began long before the Civil War . Two slave rebellions in the 1820s stoked whites\u00c2 \u2019 fears , and in response , \u00c2 \u201c many legislatures amended their laws prohibiting slaves from carrying firearms to apply the prohibition to free blacks as well , \u00c2 \u201d Thomas notes . Georgia forbade blacks to \u00c2 \u201c own , use , or carry fire arms of any description whatever.\u00c2 \u201d Florida empowered \u00c2 \u201c patrol [ s ] \u00c2 \u201d of white citizens to \u00c2 \u201c search negro houses or other suspected places , for fire arms\u00c2 \u201d ; blacks caught with guns \u00c2\u2014 whether slave or free \u00c2\u2014 were brought to the \u00c2 \u201c nearest justice of the peace\u00c2 \u201d for \u00c2 \u201c whipping on the bare back , not exceeding thirty-nine lashes.\u00c2 \u201d ( They could escape punishment by providing a \u00c2 \u201c plain and satisfactory\u00c2 \u201d explanation . ) It wasn\u00c2 \u2019 t just blacks , but also anti-slavery whites , whom governments tried to disarm . For example , during the \u00c2 \u201c Bleeding Kansas\u00c2 \u201d period \u00c2\u2014 a series of violent skirmishes in the 1850s between pro- and anti-slavery elements in that future border state \u00c2\u2014 there were attempts to take guns from the \u00c2 \u201c free-soilers.\u00c2 \u201d As the majority opinion in McDonald notes , the 1856 Republican-party platform described this as a violation of the right to keep and bear arms . When the war ended , fear of rebellion peaked , and southern governments ramped up their efforts . Some states passed laws banning black gun ownership or gun carrying , and there was a \u00c2 \u201c systematic effort\u00c2 \u201d to disarm the freedmen who had served in the Union army and then returned to their homes in the South . Roving bands of ex\u00c2\u2013Confederate soldiers , many affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan , took arms from blacks by force while official law enforcement looked the other way . In South Carolina , a group of black citizens wrote the following to Congress : \u00c2 \u201c We ask that , inasmuch as the Constitution of the United States explicitly declares that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . . . that the late efforts of the Legislature of this State to pass an act to deprive us [ of ] arms be forbidden , as a plain violation of the Constitution.\u00c2 \u201d The problem wasn\u00c2 \u2019 t just that the laws were discriminatory , forbidding blacks but not whites to own guns \u00c2\u2014 it was that the government had the right to ban gun ownership by the law-abiding at all . Even if the South had banned all gun ownership , disarmed blacks would have had to deal with the armed and racist \u00c2 \u201c state militia and state peace officers , \u00c2 \u201d the justices note . They might have added that , without technically discriminating by race , the South could have used the techniques it later employed to keep blacks from voting \u00c2\u2014 grandfather clauses , literacy tests , etc . \u00c2\u2014 to exempt whites from facially non-discriminatory gun bans . ( We see a modern analogue to these policies in laws that prevent the poor from owning guns . It costs $ 340 , nonrefundable , just to apply for a gun permit in New York City , and the rich and famous seem to have a lower likelihood of being rejected . Also , the gun-control movement periodically goes after \u00c2 \u201c Saturday-night specials\u00c2 \u201d \u00c2\u2014 that is , handguns cheap enough that the poor can afford them . ) It was gun-control laws \u00c2\u2014 along with other laws that violated virtually every right blacks had \u00c2\u2014 that led to the Fourteenth Amendment , which authorized the federal government to ensure that state and local governments respected citizens\u00c2 \u2019 rights . The Freedmen\u00c2 \u2019 s Bureau Act of 1866 , passed just two years before the amendment was approved , made it clear that the right to keep and bear arms was an important right for freed blacks to have : \u00c2 \u201c The right . . . to have full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning personal liberty , personal security , and the acquisition , enjoyment , and disposition of estate , real and personal , including the constitutional right to bear arms , shall be secured to and enjoyed by all the citizens . . . without respect to race or color , or previous condition of slavery.\u00c2 \u201d Advocates of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 cited the disarmament of freed blacks as a reason the law was necessary . These laws , however , didn\u00c2 \u2019 t work . Southern governments refused to enforce them , and the Supreme Court \u00c2\u2014 which was far less powerful then than it is today , anyhow \u00c2\u2014 did not intervene . To drive the point home that the South had to respect blacks\u00c2 \u2019 rights , including the right to bear arms , Republicans in Congress passed the Fourteenth Amendment ( they had the numbers to do this because they had refused to seat the Democrats the South had elected , many of whom were former Confederate soldiers ) , sent it to the states for ratification , put the former Confederate states under martial law via the Reconstruction Acts , and made their ratifying the amendment a condition of ending military rule . The Supreme Court\u00c2 \u2019 s decision gives Americans a lot to think about \u00c2\u2014 from the \u00c2 \u201c privileges or immunities\u00c2 \u201d clause to the Court\u00c2 \u2019 s proper role in enforcing the Constitution . But whenever we discuss gun control , we need to remember that a government capable of gun control is capable of tyranny . Both the majority opinion and Thomas\u00c2 \u2019 s concurrence in McDonald \u00c2\u2014 following in the steps of works such as Stephen P. Halbrook\u00c2 \u2019 s Securing Civil Rights \u00c2\u2014 perform the crucial service of explaining how important that fact was in the wake of the Civil War .\""

The success of Nazi programs ( restoring the economy , dispelling socio-political chaos ) and the misappropriation of justice by the apparatus of terror ( the Gestapo ) assured the compliance of the German people . Arguing otherwise assumes a resistance to Nazi rule that did not exist . Further , supposing the existance of an armed resistance also requires the acceptance that the German people would have rallied to the rebellion . This argument requires a total suspension of disbelief given everything we know about 1930s Germany . Why then did the Nazis introduce this program ? As with most of their actions ( including the formation of the Third Reich itself ) , they desired to effect a facade of legalism around the exercise of naked power . It is unreasonable to treat this as a normal part of lawful governance , as the rule of law had been entirely demolished in the Third Reich . Any direct quotations , of which there are several , that pronounce some beneficence to the Weapons Law should be considered in the same manner as all other Nazi pronouncements - absolute lies .
