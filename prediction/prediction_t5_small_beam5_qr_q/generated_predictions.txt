"This is the argument concerning 'choice'that, to me, rings untrue and is a potential weak point. The whole 'when does life begin/when is it human?'isn't where those that favor woman's rights should stake their claim.

"The thing I don't like about abortion is that it is the willful and intentional killing of an innocent human being. If abortion doesn't kill a human life, as you suggest above, then there is really no ground for opposing it. For instance, so what if it is being used as a backup contraception plan? So what if it is only being used to get revenge on a loved one? So what if it is only being used as a controlling factor?"

In fact, this point was made in the dissent of a Supreme Court opinion dealing with executing juvenile offenders. On the one hand, it is argued that juveniles do posses enough moral maturity to be able to
"Rational is as rational does. If it is our goal to raise people ’ s consciousness to the wonders of science and the power of reason, then we must apply science and reason to our own actions.

"When doctors declare that no physical cause can be found for a chronic pain this means no more than in the present state of medical knowledge, nothing can be discovered that explains why the patient feels pain. It should not be inferred that a non-physical cause is therefore the culprit. Before invoking a psycho-somatic explanation of chronic pain, we need to be certain that a purely physical cause is absent : I don't think that is possible. Medicine, like every other true science, is grounded in probabilities."

"One misconception is that Evolution doesn't explain how life formed originally or came to be. It explains how life changed after already being. Evolution is basically the change in allelle frequency over time. It helps explain how life adapts, changes and how we and modern animals came to be, not how life orignally started. That's another topic and theory. Life probably started through abiogenesis, which God conflicts with more. Life probably started with one molecule and went on, forming more complex organisms due to certain conditions and stimul

During times of limited food availability search time may be lengthened, thus increasing prey vulnerability to predation ( Anholt and Werner 1998 ). In the presence of predators,
