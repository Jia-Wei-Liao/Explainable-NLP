The conditions under which evolution operated during the Cambrian/Vendian times were different from the conditions following that time in two main ways, and these differences can potentially account for the origin of the many animal body plans during those early periods and the lack of new ones since."
"So do you think that the earth is hundreds of millions of years old?"

"A sign like that would hardly be nessecary where I live. We have very restrictive gun-laws and hardly anyone owns a gun. And no, people does not discipline themselves. You might claim I have to much trust in the government, I would claim you have to much trust in your fellow man. When you give freedom to the people you give freedom to criminals too. I don t trust guns to only be used in'selfdefense '. I want my government to uphold justice and to protect me from criminal
"Hobbes specifically said that this is not the case. Cooperation exists, and is essential. Without it, the life of man would be  a war of all against all , and would be  solitary, nasty, brutish, and short.  But man is inherently, biologically social, at the level of the family and the tribe."
"I believe the question was  who?  I'm christian and I believe in evolution. Whether it contradicts the Old Testament or not makes no difference to me. Jesus contradicted the Old Testament. The Bible is the inspired word of God, not a dictation to scribes. Men wrote the allegories describing the creation of things. Saying that mankind took a long time to understand certain things is not limiting the power of God. He could have chosen for mankind to bypass the flat-earth concept

"Someone who does evil things isn't simply not doing good things, he is specifically doing evil. Evil is not the absence of good."
"Plenty of problems with that  study  and parts of it are just hilarious. Number one, socialization plays a huge role in an individual's reaction to handling weapons. A teen who was raised in a family of outdoorsmen and exposed to firearms in a responsible, constructive fashion would react much differently than a teen who's only exposure to firearms is his way-cool arsenal in Call of Duty. I think that much the same results could be obtained with exchanging the  gun  with a football.

"Is there a point here? Didn't the dissenting Justices all agree that the right is an individual right, claimable and enforceable by individuals? It is clear the Stevens dissent was focused on a misreading of Miller's holding and his just for gun rights metamorphosis supporting the illegitimate assumption that the government can exercise vast unspecified and unenumerated powers just because it feels like it."

"And if they're stolen that means that they're illegally possessed by a currently illegal supplier. And since they're illegally possessed by an illegal supplier, that means that they're obviously not bothered by the current laws cocnerning firearms possession by criminals, meaning that banning gun ownership won't even make them blink."

"I know that sometimes when a woman is on the pill, and they happen to get pregnant anyways, it will cause you to miscarry ( not always, but sometimes ). Usually it happens very early in the pregnancy before they realize they are even pregnant. But I don't know if I would call that abortion as in the way the term is normally used, because the woman isn't terminating the pregnancy on purpose, although miscarriage is called'spontanious abortion '..

"Well, respectfully I have to disagree with you ( and I know you aren't surprised ). I've thought this over pretty thoroughly and I believe that the will of the American people is ultimately a pretty good standard to what we should institute in this country when it comes to moral issues. After all, if enough of the public had not been behind them, civil rights for black people would never have come about, nor women's suffrage. In my opinion, we don't give the American people nearly enough credit
"I believe that explains everything very well. '' Gun free zones  are nothing more than  sheep for the slaughter  and  wholesale massacre  locations that violent and murderous individuals flock to."
"You know what I find amusing here... your entire argument revolves around how it will affect your wallet. Forget about the lives of the people who are denied rights in this country that you take forgranted. That is the true christian-American spirit isn't it? Oh how proud our forefathers would be if they could see us now... oh wait... most of them owned people... nevermind."
"The first sentence is inaccurate, as is the first part of the second sentence. Therefore the quesion of 'are you not teaching your opinion, sir?'is moot. The theory of evolution has nothing to do with opinion. It matters not whether or not anyone believes in it. Evolution has been observed. There is no known evidence to suggest that evolution does not occur."

"Maybe you 'll have to clear up the difference between  understanding  and  knowing.

"I hope at that point our society will be more accepting of diversity. Women are certainly more accepting of homosexuality. I think women would not want their uterus and fetus tampered with, to be made straight, just because it would be shown to have a gene which could make it gay.

"Why the comparison of gun owners yo violent killers and serial rapists? What law have I broken? Since we are doing comparisons your anti-freedom agenda is very similar to the bazi gun control laws of the 1930s, it is like the jim crow laws of the US. Your agenda is one of racism.

"But your proof didn't claim that God could do anything possible. Maybe only one person could build a computer, maybe one person could make a car, maybe one person could run the mile in under 4 minutes. That doesn't mean that God can do ALL of these things. It means that whoever we define to be the greatest being, we can call him god and thus he exists. Of course this wouldn't be sufficient to Christians as this says that God is probably mortal and has the limits of being a physical being."
"Yes - drug use is another arena where you, the morality police and big brother can also bugger off. And just like people smoke doobies despite their being illegal - you can bet your XXX I will have an abortion if I ( me, myself, I - not you, Bush the horse or da Pope ) determine it is detrimental to myself and whatever laws you have passed to increase your comfort level and the illusion that you have actually doen anything to help ( a sad misconception ) be damned."

Grover Cleveland was elected in the 1800s. Clearly he had something to do with the alleged increase in abortion's popularity. The American Civil War occurred in the 1800s.

If you had to tell numerous stories in which God seemed to change His mind, and you had to explain every time that He really didn't change His mind, that He really knew what was going to happen but the appearance is that He DID change His mind, it would get a little cumbersome."
"I must warn you though that you have argued so perfectly and similarly all of the points I just argued on another thread about abortion, that some people around here might just accuse you of being me with a new handle. No problem though, I hope you have better luck than I did."

"And you condemn people for dancing in the blood of the victims? That's what you seem to be doing since enough information is not provided to draw any conclusions about the relationship between guns and crime."
"This obviously depends on the person. Both are not good... once again, a comparision is not gon na work. Whether you are an alcoholic or a weed-a-holic ( not a real word ) you will still mess up your health ( which is a good reason we shouldn't have public health care )."

"Right on! A real man supports those he loves, through thick and thin. He doesn't try and control the things he can't either. In the end, it's not a man's decision. It is not his body, therefore, he has no right to make the ultimate decision. He can only express his view. That's about it. ( I'm pretty sure it's not any easier for her to decide ). So cudos
"Most doctors will not perform an abortion this late without threat to the mother."
"This data point is perfectly meaningless. NONE of the other information ( or the conclusions ) presented in this talk require  26 . If we made it 260, does it change ANY of the other conclusions? No. A failure to recognize non-sequitur data tidbits is usually indicative of an argument that includes other errors."

Nor do I blame them one bit. And just to clarify your position for the board, on this  child  definition you keep insisting on. Do you mean to use that terminology for

"I think this is the first time I've ever heard anyone claim that the pro-choice movement is for the sake of the child."
"This is different than stating that abortion is the same, in principle, as killing a born child. We are back on the question of  Why would someone do this horrible thing  which pro-life people continually ask and has been answered in many ways by many people. There are many threads on the subject That the fetus did not come into existance by it's own choice is really irrelevant. That it did not cause problems of it's own actions does not mean that it does not cause problems."
"So let me make sure I have it right, in order to be a family-man/Catholic, I must be anti-abortion and against the rights of homosexuals. Is this what makes a good family-man/Catholic ; denying the rights of those who are different from what is considered by some to be  normal , and telling others what to do with their body?"

Can we get anyone to listen and change society, ooooor will you just use this problem, and these under trained and under socialized kids to persecute the 2nd Amendment!

"I think this is a different matter than, say, displaying religious icons on courtroom walls or grounds, which is a clear endorsement of religion by the government. The 18th amendment was religion-motivated, but it didn't get rescinded for THAT reason. It got rescinded because it didn't work practically.

"Really? Why? Bacteria don't need to see to exist. They don't depend on light to live. In fact, bacteria thrive in dark, moist areas. Why would natural selection determine this ability as being advantageous? If populations of bacteria with the ability to sense light are  better suited  than other bacteria, how many different types of light-sensing bacteria are there?"
"As Mach pointed out, you ( Montalban ) are arguing with yourself here. You stated that  bacteria needing nylon to survive  is put forth as evidence for evolution. Then you said that an alternate view was that there are some bacteria that need nylon to survive. Anyway, an actual alternate view is that the experiments performed to determine whether the bacteria could survive on nylon alone could not have been exhaustive. There may still be a natural substance on which the bacteria survives. It may even be similar to nylon, but it has yet to be discovered

"Yes, I would. The term is not simply just words. The definition of Civil Unions do not allow for the over 1,100 rights, liberties and protections granted to otherwise Legally Married couples. Civil Unions are non-transportable, meaning a civil union from one state can not be recognized in other states. Now if you would like to call ALL legally recognized unions as Legal marriage, fine. That goes for heterosexuals as well. I just can't see that a heterosexual couple would ever want to enter into

"And it provides no real insight to the issue. It states detail on California case, but makes little specification on any of the other states.

Well so far you've claimed that science MIGHT one day know everything about you. What a hoot."
"Could be phrased in a more polite way. Probably the whole name of this forum should be changed from creation versus evolution to creationism versus alternatives. Because every creationist I have seen on this board has used the creationist definition of evolution which non-creationists flatly reject and it wastes time. The replys to this very thread show that many people know the correct defintion of biological evolution and do not tolerate any other definition.

"Actually gun crime in the UK is at a very low level. If you believe government statistics then gun crime is at its lowest level for years.

"Actually, a few studies I've seen suggest exactly that. Looking at the birth rates among the various ethnic groups, and correcting for better birth control, etc, the rate actually remained fairly constant from before the Roe v Wade decision to the years afterwards. This suggests that the number of abortions remained fairly constant, they simply became legal to perform and recieve. My feeling is, the desire and need for the abortion option has always been there. The legality will affect it, but not to a great extent

"You're telling us we're soft on crime? You're the one who is portraying the two men who were shot as victims and dismissing their crimes. It's ironic, those two criminals who cross the border illegally with malevolent intentions, robbed a guys house, and were legally killed are poor, innocent victims, yet this 80 year old man who just tried to defend himself and didn't hurt anybody is a mothertrucking, baby-eating criminal who deserves to be locked up

"Again, ecological factors play an important role. If the first birds were aggressive carnivores that attacked other aggressive dinosaurs, this may hold water. Yet their skeletal structure suggest that they were small, agile and light dinosaurs equipped for eating insects and such. The Theropods actually had to gain muscle to provide powered flight which was a later development. Monkey"
"Besides being terribly wrong, that's not evolution and has nothing to do with evolution. Perhaps because you know so little about orbital physics you think that the sun rising and setting is any kind of evidence for the earth orbiting the sun. It isn't. You would have to actually understand a little about it to know that. Nobody, from Copernicus onward, used observations of the revolution of the earth to conclude that the earth was in orbit around the sun."

It can deny that it isn't science if it can not be explained by naturalistic observation. Most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. Science can make no assertion as to what you saw. You may think it is wonderful, but LSD had that effect. How strange that

Two of his sons were knighted ( Sir George Darwin, F.R.S., and Sir Francis Darwin, F.R.S. ) and they lived to be 67 and 77, quite respectable ages for their time. Sir George was a mathematician and astronomer and Sir Francis was botanist."
"You mean like showing what the Scientific Method is, and why this invalidates all creationists claims of doing science as outright lies? Do you want me to elaborate on that? Or did you mean the challenge of the creationist lie of  adaptation  not being Evolution? Do you want me to elaborate on that? Or the inane claim by bertvan that living systems all can react intelligently to stimuli ( f.ex. I wonder how you think lichen react to stimuli with intelligence? ) Is that what you wanted me to elaborate
"How would you like to have a parasite in your body and not be given treatment to remove it based solely on the fact that even parasitic organisms are living things and deserve life?"
"It's bad enough that you claim to oppose evolution when you don't even know what it is, but to correct someone on logic and get it backwards is really silly. If you limit your claims of creation to the simple assertion,  God did it!  without any specifics as to how, then you have answered no questions and explained nothing. Such empty assertions can not be proven wrong."

"Can you tell us what you would accept as  proof ? You can be shown any number of transitional sequences that demonstrate evidence, but the level of evidence needed for your own personal  proof  is up to you. Proof is for mathematics, science works by evaluating competing theories using evidence and eliminating those which do not predict observed results."
"The points individually have already been answered but actually you will find out that there is no complete proof for anything. No one can really tell you a definite answer to these questions.

Dr Stanley Jaki has documented how the scientific method was still-born in all cultures apart from the Judeo-Christian culture in Europe ( Science and Creation ( Edinburgh and London : Scottish Academic Press, 1974 ). An orderly universe makes perfect sense if it was made by an orderly Creator. But if there is no creator, or if Zeus and his gang were in charge, why should there be any order at all?

"Evolution is a science. '' Evolutionism  is a word coined by creationists to make evolution sound more like a matter of faith than science."
"Well, if that is your perspective, yes, I can see why you would think they are the same idea. However, the differences between the two theories are much, much more fundamental than just the wording. Perhaps the most obvious difference is that creationism is a committed structure of theological beliefs, while ID is based entirely on scientific evidence. Although it is true that ID has theological implications, the same could be said of evolution, the big bang, and, for that matter, any theory regarding the origin of biology and

Would people have died if you had acted vigilante?"
"No. That's not what I said. I said that natural selection is differential reproductive success. I said that those organisms that possessed advantageous characteristics would tend to reach reproductive age more frequently and therefore they will tend to produce more offspring, while those with disadvantageous characteristics will tend to produce fewer offspring. As a result, the heritable characteristics of the population will change over time."

"You sure about that? I think you will find that that view is oversimplyfied and not in accordance with the history of the subject. Big Bang : Evolutionists are not concerned with the BB, per sae. Cosmologists on the other hand are. In very simple terms we have a factual observation : the universe is expanding with time. If we say, what does this mean for the past of th universe it can be postulated that the universe then becomes very small and hot if we go far back enough in time
"Actually, evolution, as used by biologists, is not the study of origins of life. It is the theory that explains how new species arise, and why the present species ( and past species in the fossil record ) have the characteristics that they do, not only in form but also in spatial and temporal extent."
"You are missing the fact that the theory of evolution is the explanation for the observations. Evolution does not explain itself. The theory of evolution explains things from the single genetic code for all living organisms, to the observed nested hierarchy, to the progression of life apparent in the fossil record, to why organisms seem designed for their environment."
"I'm glad to see you've finally come around."
"That's true, but how much have we actually learned, and how much have we theorized, with an atheist presupposition, the only presupposition currently allowed?"
"Oh, we don't have to - sorry, I wasn't clear enough there."
"Actually, his definition of evolution is exactly correct. In fact, I notice that you even acknowledge that he is correct in the last sentence of the paragraph."
"Really. Please cite where Darwin discussed  Macro Evolution.  What paper or book, and what chapter? What did he say about it that is hilarious. Have you actually read Darwin? Perhaps his paper on earth worms? Or maybe his paper on the formation of coral islands? I haven't read either of those or most of his other works. But I happen to have a copy of On The Origin Of Species and I can't find any discussion of  Macro Evolution. "
"Actually it wouldn't. Since there is no rational, believable evidence for creationism, it wouldn't be any more believable if evolution were disproved."
"oh ye of little faith..... i pity you"
"you mistake one hominid for another and cite the words of a known fraud on the piltdown man instead of the other hominid."
"Actually, you are misreprenting the scienctific answer in the following manner 1 ) It is not evolutionists, it is astrophysicists.. 2 ) It is based on testable observations.. 3 ) Based on the available data, it is about 13.5 billion years old. 4 ) It does not address the issue of 'Why we are here'at all. 5 ) It is not based on faith, but based on data. If data comes into change
"I think that you should check with cosmologists, astrophysicists, astronomers and the like to see why most scientists accept the findings of those sciences, even evolutionists."
"I am not really sure what you are trying to prove except maybe you think it sounds impressive?? The line 'they assumed that the tonsils and the apendix were rements of previous specious'is a total nonsense sentance, and renders the entire paragraph worthless."
"Why for heavens sake would they do such a thing? Whats the motivation? And why resort to attacks if the data are on your side. You know the old admonition to lawyers about when to argue what do you not?"
"That was the whole point of asking the questions, to prove evolution isn't an absolute truth."
"Because there are people who are trying to deny the theory of evolution it's place as a vital part of public school's biology curriculum."
"No, they don't. Creationists do. '' Why haven't all animals turned into humans? "
"The big bang, life from non-life, the progression of life from the simple to the complex, just to name a few. None of these can be proved ( even on the balance of probabilities ) to be true by operations science. All of these contradict scientific observations of the present. As a result, you must take them by purely blind faith."
"I think the shoe is on the other foot so to speak..... YEC has not made any valid rebuttal of evolution or the AoE yet, and that is the camp which is making claims for absolute truth"
"They are not. Read carefully. Try to look at the big picture rather than limit your thinking to such a narrow concept."
"All of them since I don't know what quotes you are referring to at all."
"So you think that only the sentence structure needs to be examined and not the meaning of the words?"
"No, it doesn't. It is an example of how one part of the theory of evolution works to effect changes in a population."
"Can you show me the stats for this, are we dealing with 2003/4 numbers compared to before the ban, or the year after?"
"So will they be in front of or behind a leaf?"
"My point was that the Supreme Court has been wrong before so assuming that the Supreme Court is always correct about an issue is unjustified."
"There are some very rare cases where abortion is legitimately allowable by society. However, most abortions do not fall under this catagory."

"One of these aspects of existence which we arbitarily believe in is cause and effect."
"I think that is the most interesting part. This wasn't just a lucky find. This demonstrate the power of theory, that it is predictive. Based on a prior theoretically understanding, they hypothesized that the creature would be where it was. As the hypothesis proved correct, this further adds to the validity of the original theory."

"So your point is that there are a lot of stupid people out there?"
"Following the original purpose of this thread, I will summarize my own views on abortion. ( Note, this is copied from an older survey on abortion beliefs - a thread in the abortion forum called  Survey of views on abortion  ) : For me, the question of abortion rights comes down to a balance between the rights of the mother and the rights of the fetus. On the side of the rights of the mother, there is a very important right to the right to life of a fetus kicks in

"The theory of evolution is based on evidence, the existence of god, is not.. Reason can not be applied to it. Furthermore, since evolution relies on reason, faith can not be applied to it. To attempt to label science as a faith is a contradiction. I know it irks you that your faith can not be proven, but that's the definition of faith!! It wouldn't be faith without it. As Montalban says in a contradiction of motives : His particular faith does not
"It is? If a child grew up never hearing the words religion, gods, spirits, etc. would this child still have faith of some sort? Is faith some innate human tendency? It could be seeing as how there is the  god spot  in the brain, but maybe the god spot wouldn't develop as fully in the child that was never exposed to religion or thoughts of the supernatural. Then again, kids are scared of the dark..."
"Indeed! At least you recognize the nature of your own statement."
"Yes. It's not logical to simply cite,  the Bible tells me so, the Bible was written by God,  and consider that an argument. The Bible has been wrong. It's also not logical to cite authority to God. It necessarily begs further questions about your God's unproven existence to those who don't believe in that God, or in any God. Should each religion have it's own definition or completely different idea of logic, which favours that religion
"I )  false impression by stating that a Christian Pastor believes that bigotry blocked Gay Marriage.  2 )  Had the title said, pro-gay pastor believes bigotry blocked gay marriage  The only difference here being that you would want to label him as  pro-gay  and exclude  Christian . By the same token, should we remove  Christian  and replace it  anti-gay  from any pastor that speaks against homosexuality? Naw. Of course not

"Yes, God does take away sinful desires. ( If you ask Him. ) I'm not saying that it doesn't take any work on your part, though. When you have a sinful desire, you allow a thought to become more than just a stray idea. You foster and encourage the thought and it becomes a desire. God takes away the desires, helps you deal with your  stray thoughts , and shows you how to keep them from becoming desires."

"Given my last paragraph it should be clear why I don't agree with this. I also am not aware of any theories that imply any kind of extratemporal phenomena, only speculations as to what ( if anything ) may have happened before the Big Bang. If anything did ( eg previous Big Crunch ) that is not outside time, that is only time that is inaccessible to us in terms of observation."
"I'm always interested in arguments where 'image'assumes physical likeness. When God said, 'Let us make man in our image and likeness...

Easily understood when man created his own god. But what if 'image'refers to character and personality, not physical appearance? Man really is

"Well, Satan was invented to explain why there is evil in the world.. the dualism. He was adopted by the Hebrews under the influence of Persia. However, in the Jewish religion, Satan is not this incredilbly evil being out to corrupt souls, but rather just an angel ( who had no free will ), whose job it was to provide for bad choices so that people may choose GOOD, and thus live more sanctified lives by their own actions."

"That doesn't prove the government shouldn't be armed. It's not like one politician can single-handedly kill millions of people. In fact, if the whole U.S. Congress one day decided to get up from their offices and try to invade a small town called Kittanning, Pennsylvania, they would fail. What it does prove that the government takes guns away because they don't trust the little people. We should all start wondering  why not? "

"But that's not even how  creation science , or any religiously motivated science works. There is no checking involved - what I mean by that is that answers are always ad hoc. It doesn't matter if there is a better explanation available that does not involve mythology and superstition, if observations can be made to fit the religious scenario, it is evidence. Again, there is no checking of facts, i.e., no testing, and of course, no predictions

Who proclaims that man and chimps sharing a common ancestor is an established scientific theory? A theory is defined as a well tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observation.

"Supply is already controlled. The Gun Control Act of 1968 lists individuals who're prohibited from firearms ownership or possession, one of the groups that're prohibited are individuals who've been found guilty of a felony offense. That means the legal network is about as tightly regulated as it can be while still remaining open to the public."
"You really have a strange definition of faith. Scientific laws require reproducible results ( patterns ). That's how they got to be laws. I believe that the acceleration due to the gravity of the earth will have the same value tomorrow that it had yesterday because there is no indication that this pattern will change. It's not because of faith, or at least certainly not due to the kind of faith required to believe in the supernatural."

"Really? Care to point out which facts she misrepresented? It is our contention that it's the pro-death advocates who misrepresent the facts in order to justify their infanticidal proclivities and justifications as they release women of all personal responsibility and expect the innocent child to be sacrificed at the alter of their immoral lifestyle so they can continue to act irresponsibly."

"The problem with happenstance origins is that there is no evidence, and it's simply not possible to falsify it. If we were able to prove so many scientific proceedures ( from abiogenesis to radiometric dating - all based on the presupposition that there is no God ) were indisputably true, then ID would be falsified.

"That's NOT the equivalent of ID - you're mixing causes & effects. The theory of evolution, and the theory of intelligent design would equally observe, measure, and publish the effects of the apple falling. Then the evolutionists would say that happenstance origins caused gravity to work that way, and ID proponents would say that a supernatural design caused gravity to work that way. Students shouldn't have it implied to them that happenstance origins are the only possible cause of gravitational behavior. Your  apple falling

I mean if you are worried about it being a valued creature then what changed?"
"This question is premised on an untenable assumption : that people should not be allowed to vote on particular issues. This premise is clearly not true in any democratic society, and is especially not true in the United States.

"Oh, really, pregnancy is not expensive? Have you gone through a pregnancy? I talked with numerous friends who went through pregnancies, and the costs were astonishing - from the doctor visits, to the actual delivery which can cost well into the thousands ( tens of thousands if there are difficulties with the birth ). Just the visit I made shortly before getting an abortion was expensive. As for adoption, there very well may be no cost in the actual procedure- but there certainly are numerous costs - both monetarily and physically- before it
